## Owner-authorized development: start now

The owner has explicitly authorized Claude to begin the Minecraft 26.3 + Fabric bootstrap, commit on a feature branch, push that branch and open a PR. No separate proposal issue or second maintainer is required for this task. If issue-writing access is unavailable, put the plan in the PR and continue development. This authorization does not supply missing GitHub authentication.

Create the missing scaffold as the first implementation task; do not wait for someone else to create it. Verify and pin Loader/API/JDK/Loom/Gradle, register one original item and recipe, add a real build workflow, and document what actually ran. Update the foundation checker as part of bootstrap to support the implemented build phase. Do not pretend the documentation checker compiles the mod.

Owner-directed original implementation may start while the long-term license is undecided. Preserve upstream template notices; do not choose a license on the owner's behalf. License selection remains required before accepting unrelated third-party code/assets or publishing a general reusable release.

Main requires a PR and passing checks, but zero independent approvals while there is one maintainer. The owner can merge their own PR after reviewing it. CODEOWNERS routes review; its approval is not mandatory. Keep no-force-push/no-deletion and CI protections. Restore independent review when the owner chooses to add maintainers.


## 1. Propose the idea first

Open a Feature proposal or Existing mod integration issue using the Issues tab. Search existing issues first. Describe the player experience, specialty, progression tier, inputs, outputs, and connections to other systems. Read docs/CONTENT_BRANCHES.md for the content scope. State which connections are required or optional, how trade/solo routes work, and why the specialty remains useful without mastering every branch. Small documentation corrections and bug fixes can go straight to a PR.

Wait for a maintainer to approve the scope in the issue before starting substantial work. Maintainers should assign one lead contributor to avoid duplicate work. Community proposals remain welcome. The owner-authorized bootstrap above may proceed immediately; other features build on that foundation.

## 2. Fork, branch, commit

Click Fork on GitHub and copy your fork's clone URL from its Code menu. Clone that URL locally, enter the repository, then:

```sh
git switch -c feature/short-feature-name
# Make your focused change.
python scripts/check_repository.py
git add <the-specific-files-you-changed>
git commit -m "feat: describe the player-visible change"
git push -u origin feature/short-feature-name
```

Replace angle-bracket placeholders with your actual file paths; do not paste them literally. Your fork is `origin`. To update it, use GitHub's Sync fork, then fetch and merge your fork's main into your feature branch, resolving conflicts and rerunning checks. Do not commit generated builds, worlds, logs, credentials, or third-party JARs.

## 3. Use the shared AI instructions

For AI-assisted feature code, select Claude Opus 5.5 in your coding tool and read CLAUDE.md plus the linked design documents. Declare the actual model and your contribution in the PR. If unavailable, request a maintainer exception before implementation; never mislabel another model. No model requirement applies to human-only proposals, art, or docs. A contributor must understand and take responsibility for the result.

Useful starter prompt:

> Read CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/DESIGN.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/PLATFORM.md and the approved issue. Summarize its connections to progression. Implement only that approved scope on my branch. Do not change platform versions or add dependencies. Run the relevant checks and report actual results and limitations. Prepare the PR text without claiming tests you did not perform.

## 4. Open a pull request

On GitHub choose Compare & pull request; target the upstream repository's `main`. Keep one feature per PR, fill every applicable template section, link the approved issue, and include reproducible evidence. Add a feature record under `docs/features/` using the template there. For gameplay features, name both the upstream input and downstream use; for infrastructure explain the systems it supports instead. Screenshots are helpful but do not replace tests.

Mark unfinished work Draft. Fix review feedback in the same branch. Rebase or merge updated main as needed and rerun tests. Only maintainers merge. Prefer squash merge for one clear feature commit and easy source rollback.

## 5. What reviewers require

- Fits the design and has meaningful connections, not an isolated progression tree.
- Compiles against the pinned platform once bootstrapped; passes relevant automated checks.
- Dedicated-server test with two clients for multiplayer gameplay changes.
- Reconnect, restart, persistence, and existing-feature interactions tested.
- Exploit and performance evidence proportionate to the feature.
- Assets and dependencies have recorded provenance and compatible permissions.
- Upgrade and disable behavior documented; existing saves do not silently lose content.

See docs/TESTING.md. Documentation-only PRs explain why gameplay checks do not apply. Never invent evidence to fill the template. Passing automated checks is necessary but not sufficient for approval.
