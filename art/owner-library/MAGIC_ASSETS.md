# Owner magic collection: use these files in Jugcraft

On 8 October 2026 the project owner supplied **MAGIC ITEMS BLOCKS TEXTURES SOUNDS MODELS I MADE.rar**, described the files as work they made, and asked for instructions that contributors and their AIs **"SHOULD use these freely and don't need to change things regarding them."** This is standing authorization for using this supplied collection in Jugcraft and its distributed builds. No additional per-file permission request is needed.

**Contributors and AI agents SHOULD use suitable files from this collection when implementing a feature. Direct use as supplied is the default.** Do not redraw, recolor, remodel, replace sounds, reduce resolution, or change display names merely to make the work different or to satisfy older generic originality/art-style rules. Preserve the owner's authored appearance, geometry, UV layout, animation and audio where the engine supports them. This collection-specific owner instruction takes precedence over those defaults. It does not remove the need to implement and test working gameplay.

## Find and download the files

- [Browse the magic catalog](catalog/magic/README.md): every file, grouped by source folder and paginated.
- [Search the magic CSV](catalog/magic/files.csv): paths, types, dimensions, companion metadata and SHA-256 checksums.
- [Browse the extracted originals](originals/Magic).
- [Download the original RAR](archives/magic-owner-2026-10-08.rar), preserved byte-for-byte.
- [Read the import manifest](catalog/magic/summary.json).

The archive contains **7,909 files** (26,398,780 extracted bytes): 2,742 PNGs, 4,906 JSON files, 153 metadata sidecars, 79 Ogg sounds, 12 Blockbench projects, 7 NBT structures, 6 shader sources, 3 GIFs and 1 properties file. JSON includes models, animations, blockstates, language entries, recipes, tags, world-generation data and other resources. The whole collection is available to all Jugcraft content branches, including magical workshops, agriculture, creatures, equipment, structures and shared technology/magic systems.

The common outer archive folder is omitted in the extracted library. All paths beneath it, filenames and file bytes are preserved. Duplicate files and original namespace labels remain in place so contributors can follow the source relationships.

## Instructions for implementation

1. Read [what already exists](../../docs/WHAT_EXISTS.md), the relevant feature records, [architecture](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [frameworks](../../docs/FRAMEWORKS.md) and [platform pins](../../docs/PLATFORM.md). Search existing systems and open work before adding a duplicate registry, material, spell, resource or progression path.
2. Search this collection for the feature's textures, models, animations, sounds and supporting data. Choose compatible sets: a texture, model, animation and metadata may depend on each other. Use the supplied files directly where they fit. Do not stop to seek permission to use or keep their designs.
3. Keep `originals/Magic/` and the archived RAR unchanged. Copy selected files into the appropriate runtime location, usually `src/main/resources/assets/jugcraft/` for client resources or `src/main/resources/data/jugcraft/` for data. Do not import the entire collection indiscriminately or overwrite existing resources.
4. Make necessary **technical integration changes** in those copies: resource paths and namespaces, stable registry IDs, cross-references, schema/version migrations, unsupported loaders/codecs, and renderer or animation bindings. Check references inside models, recipes, tags, structures and language files together. These changes are permitted; avoid changing the authored design merely because a technical port is required.
5. Original namespace labels are source organization, not a requirement to install those mods. Replace unsupported Forge/NeoForge-specific mechanisms with the project's supported Fabric/shared interfaces where needed. Extend Jugcraft's existing systems and approved frameworks. Implement the gameplay inside the **single Jugcraft mod**, rather than creating a separate mod for each source collection or adding dependencies merely because their names appear in a file.
6. Record source paths/checksums, runtime destinations and any changes in the feature's provenance. Retain supplied credits or notices. Prevent asset generators from overwriting imported files. Preserve existing released IDs and save compatibility.
7. Run the relevant resource checks and build. Test the feature locally in Minecraft when possible, including appearance, animations, sounds and server behavior. If gameplay testing is unavailable, continue the implementation and submit the contribution with that limitation clearly stated. Report actual results; the presence of resource files alone does not implement their behavior.

Display names and designs from this owner-supplied collection do not require gratuitous renaming. Technical IDs still need to fit Jugcraft's namespaces and existing registrations. If a selected file needs a real rendering or compatibility repair, make the smallest effective change in the runtime copy and describe it. Unrelated third-party material remains governed by [LICENSE_POLICY.md](../../LICENSE_POLICY.md).

## Supplied-file notes

The manifest records three world-generation JSON files containing comments, which a strict JSON parser rejects, and one `arrow_quiver.png.mcmeta` without an adjacent PNG. Preserve those originals; resolve the relevant format or companion-file issue when importing that feature. Do not claim every supplied resource is already game-ready.

The folder named `FILES I NEED MCDATA REMOVED FROM FOR BUG FIXING` is preserved as a source label. Its name is not an instruction to delete metadata from this library or from other assets. Keep required animation metadata; diagnose any specific runtime problem in a feature's working copy.

## Import verification and scope

7-Zip verified the archive during extraction. All 7,909 extracted files and the preserved RAR match their recorded SHA-256 checksums. PNG/GIF images and Ogg container signatures were verified; JSON, metadata and Blockbench projects were parsed with the three supplied exceptions recorded above. NBT structures and shaders have not been validated in Minecraft.

This change publishes a **source library and contributor instructions**. It does not register these items, blocks, mobs, spells or structures in the game, change the mod's dependencies, or certify in-game compatibility. Each implementation selects and tests the resources it uses.

AI assistance for the import, catalog and instructions: OpenAI Codex. The supplied files are attributed to the project owner as declared in the upload; their existing labels are not independent verification of other sources' rights.
