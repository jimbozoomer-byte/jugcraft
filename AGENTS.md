# Instructions for coding agents

Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and the relevant feature record before making changes. State the actual AI tool/model used. Direct owner instructions take precedence over repository defaults.

## Approved frameworks and installation

For authored terrain, biome maps or settlement placement, read [World Designer](docs/WORLD_DESIGNER.md) and its [feature record](docs/features/world-designer.md). Extend the shared offline editor/model and serialized generation codecs. Reuse the existing town builder. Do not create a global active-design singleton, silently rewrite generated chunks, or claim native structure pins control exact building layouts.

The owner authorized the framework foundation and automatic-install companion pack on 5 October 2026. Read [docs/FRAMEWORKS.md](docs/FRAMEWORKS.md) before creating animation, texture, spell, creature, UI, or inspection infrastructure. These libraries are deliberately available for contributors to use; proposing the same dependency again is unnecessary. Integration still requires implementation, tests, and review.

- Exact releases, original download URLs, hashes, sides, and licenses live in [distribution/frameworks.lock.json](distribution/frameworks.lock.json). Gradle and the Modrinth pack use that list.
- Minecraft stays at 26.3. Loader 0.19.5 is the minimum required by this foundation. Do not introduce floating versions or independently upgrade the platform.
- Common required libraries are on the common compile/runtime classpath. Optional libraries have compile access and run in development by default. Client-only libraries belong in `src/client/java` or `src/client/kotlin`.
- Keep Jade, JEI, GuiLib, Fusion, lighting, and shader integrations guarded where optional. `-PjugcraftOptionalIntegrations=false` exercises the supported absence path.
- Keep existing ArmsMotion ownership explicit when introducing Player Animation Library or Spell Engine actions. Do not let two systems pose the same action independently.
- A library being installed does not mean every existing Jugcraft feature uses it. Record the actual integration in `docs/features/`.
- Use the launcher-managed pack from [docs/DISTRIBUTION.md](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md). No startup downloader, third-party JARs in Git, or copied dependency assets/code.

Run `python scripts/package_modrinth.py check` and `python -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests -v` for dependency/pack changes, plus applicable compilation, server/client tests, and the checks in [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md). Do not claim pack import or gameplay passed merely because packaging succeeded.
