# Biomes branch

Status: **in progress** on branch `claude/biomes`. Batch 1 (seasonal forests, with the region engine) is green in CI; batch 2 (fields and meadows, with region layouts) is green in CI; batches 3 (wetlands) and 4 (warm and dry, with Jugcraft surfaces) are green in CI; batches 5 (big trees and rainforests) and 6 (mountains, coasts and volcanoes) are being built. The owner asked to carry on through every batch. Everything below is a design proposal, not a promise; each batch records its own feature document and test evidence under `docs/features/` when it is built. Nothing here has been played.

On 2 October 2026 the owner shared a catalog of the Biomes O' Plenty mod's biomes (compiled from its fan wiki: 143 pages) and asked to "remake all these within our mod". They chose:
- **Placement:** Jugcraft regions (below).
- **Scope:** every biome in the catalog except those that are now vanilla Minecraft biomes, Nether and End included.
- **First batch:** the seasonal forests.

## Rules for the remake

- **Original work only** ([LICENSE_POLICY.md](../../LICENSE_POLICY.md)). Every biome, tree, plant, block, texture and line of code is Jugcraft's own. The catalog's descriptions and screenshots guide the concept only, as the references in [ART_DIRECTION.md](../ART_DIRECTION.md) do; no other mod's code, data, textures or wiki text is copied, and the catalog itself is not committed.
- **Names.** Biomes named after real ecosystems keep their real names (Bayou, Bog, Redwood Forest, Lavender Field, Tundra). Names that Biomes O' Plenty invented (for example Origin Valley, Mystic Grove, Visceral Heap) get original Jugcraft names, listed below. Distinctive invented woods and blocks get original equivalents too.
- **Seasons.** Every biome with four seasons joins `#jugcraft:has_seasons` and `#jugcraft:has_winter_snow` ([features/seasons.md](../features/seasons.md)). Biomes O' Plenty's separate snowy variants of temperate biomes (Snowy Maple Woods, Snowy Dead Forest, Snowy Tundra) come from Jugcraft's winter instead; permanently snowy biomes exist only where the climate is frozen.
- **Deciduous trees follow the seasons** like Alpine Spawn's larch ([features/alpine-spawn.md](../features/alpine-spawn.md)): green in spring and summer, autumn colours, bare in winter, from the server's season clock.
- **Connections.** Each batch connects its biomes to existing content (the agriculture branch's crops, the sawmill and tree farm, the shared wood-set code) and records tier, producers, consumers and failure behaviour in its feature document, as [CONTENT_BRANCHES.md](../CONTENT_BRANCHES.md) asks of cozy surface biomes.
- **Duplicates are skipped**: biomes that became vanilla Minecraft biomes (Cherry Grove, Mangrove Swamp, Badlands, Bamboo Jungle and others), and two that were cancelled before release. Alpine Spawn already covers the Alps.

## Placement: Jugcraft regions

Fifty-odd new Overworld biomes cannot all take slices of vanilla's climate table without shrinking vanilla's biomes away, so the Overworld is divided into large regions:
- About 1 km across (`biomes.region_size`), shaped as irregular cells. A share of them (`biomes.region_share`, half by default) are **Jugcraft regions**; the rest stay pure vanilla.
- A Jugcraft region uses one of four **layouts**: vanilla's climate table with that layout's replacements (for example, taiga becomes Coniferous Forest). Their characters: woodland (seasonal forests, big trees), meadow (fields; warm and dry lands), wetland (wetlands, coasts) and wild (mountains, volcanoes, wonders). A biome may grow in several layouts. Vanilla biomes keep their full size in vanilla regions, and the replacements leave the rest of a layout alone.
- Terrain does not depend on biomes, so a region border shows as a change of biome, not a cliff.
- The region of a place comes from the world seed, so a seed always makes the same world.
- Alpine Spawn (the start) and the Pixel Hollows are in every region.
- Nether and End biomes use Fabric API's Nether and End biome placement instead.

The engine and its settings are recorded in [features/biome-regions.md](../features/biome-regions.md).

## The catalog, entry by entry

Every page in the catalog, what Jugcraft does with it, and in which batch. "Removed" means the catalog marks it removed or outdated in Biomes O' Plenty; removed biomes are remade too unless they are vanilla duplicates.

## Open questions
- Region size and share are first guesses; the batch 1 client test logs how far the first world has to go to find each new biome.
- Marrow Heap (the catalog's Visceral Heap and Parasitic Heap) should be bone and gristle rather than gore, to suit Jugcraft's cozy tone.
- The Promised Land biomes (Hallowed Bog, Highsun Meadow, Gilded Shrubland, Starlit Wood, Lush River) came from a removed sky dimension. They are planned as Overworld wonders for now; the realms branch may want them instead.
