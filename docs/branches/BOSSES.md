# Bosses branch (brainstorm)

Status: **a brainstorm, nothing built yet.** On 4 October 2026 the owner asked for variant weapons, many of them "drops from bosses ill make later", themed around those bosses ("example: Yeti King"), and to "brainstorm bosses we could make". This page is that brainstorm. The bosses' weapons already exist: Arms VII ([features/arms-vii.md](../features/arms-vii.md)) adds two trophies for each of the first eight bosses below, and their loot tables are ready (`data/jugcraft/loot_table/bosses/<boss>.json`, one of the two per roll). Building a boss is a separate, reviewed feature each time. Everything here is a proposal for the owner to pick from, change or drop.

## Rules every boss follows

From [CONTENT_BRANCHES.md](../CONTENT_BRANCHES.md) ("Caves, dungeons and bosses" and "Rare loot"):
- **An arena with edges:** a lair, or a summoning that builds one. The boss does not wander out of it, and it resets when everyone leaves.
- **Readable attacks:** every big attack is telegraphed (a wind-up, a sound, a shadow on the ground) and can be dodged or blocked.
- **Recovery:** dying in the fight is not the end; gear can be fetched back, and the boss heals and resets rather than keeping its gains.
- **Multiplayer:** its health scales with the players in the arena; every player who fought gets a roll of its loot table, not just the last hit.
- **No griefing:** a summoned boss cannot be called inside a town's protection or another player's claim, and its attacks do not break player builds.
- **No farming loop:** a long respawn timer per lair (or a costly summoning item), so a trophy stays a trophy.
- **Optional:** no core progression needs a boss. Its trophies are side-grades with a boon, and each boss also drops something useful to non-fighters (a crafting material, a decoration, a trophy head).

## The first eight (trophies built)

| Boss | Home | Encounter idea | Trophies (boon) | Loot table |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **The Yeti King** | Tundra, Ice Sheet, Frost Rift | A white ape twice a player's height, wearing an ice crown. It throws ice boulders, its ground slam freezes the floor slick, and its roar calls lesser yetis. A cave lair in a glacier. | Glacier Maul (maul), Rimeclaw (katar): **Frost** | `bosses/yeti_king` |
| **The Cinder Tyrant** | Volcano, Magma Fields, Ashfall Wastes | A salamander lord in obsidian armour, with magma in its cracks. It rains cinders, a lava wave runs from it, and its armour sheds when cooled with water. | Cinderbrand (greatsword), Magmaw (earthbreaker): **Ember** | `bosses/cinder_tyrant` |
| **The Mire Hag** | Bog, Quagmire, Sludge Mire, Hallowed Bog | A witch of the deep swamp who hides in the fog among illusions of herself. She throws poison brews and binds players with roots; strike the real one, which casts a shadow. | Hagthorn (scythe), Bogfang (kama): **Venom** | `bosses/mire_hag` |
| **The Crypt Lich** | The graveyard's crypts, Ghost Forest | A crowned skeleton sorcerer below a crypt. It raises the restless dead in waves, drains life with a soul beam, and hides its heart in a phylactery that must be broken first. | Soulreaver (moonblade): **Drain**; Gravewarden (executioner): **Wither** | `bosses/crypt_lich` |
| **The Iron Dreadnought** | The front line (trench works) | A walking war machine bigger than the landship, with steam vents and tesla coils. It charges in straight lines, its coils arc between players who stand close, and its weak vents glow before they open. | Dynamo Halberd (halberd), Piston Hammer (war hammer): **Shock** | `bosses/iron_dreadnought` |
| **The Alpha Werewolf** | Gloomweald and dark forests, on a full moon | The pack leader of the werewolves already in the world, twice their size. It leaps between trees, howls to weaken players and call the pack, and flees to heal at dawn. | Moonfang (sabre), Howler (twinblade): **Howl** | `bosses/werewolf_alpha` |
| **The Storm Roc** | Highland, Karst Pinnacles | A thunderbird nesting on the tallest pinnacle. It dives with lightning strikes and gusts that throw players off the peak; its nest's lightning rods can be turned against it. | Stormcaller (glaive), Galefeather (estoc): **Gale** | `bosses/storm_roc` |
| **The Abyssal Leviathan** | Ocean Trench | A sea serpent in the trench's depths. It drags boats under, its whirlpool pulls players in, and it is fought from a sunken temple's ledges. | Tidebreaker (war fork), Leviathan's Hook (bill): **Tide** | `bosses/abyssal_leviathan` |

Each boss's table is ready for its encounter to roll on death. Until the bosses exist, their trophies are in the creative Combat tab only.

## More bosses to consider (no trophies yet)

- **The Pumpkin King** (Halloween nights): a giant scarecrow made of the harvest. It would be summoned with heirloom pumpkins in a bounded field, and it ties into the giant pumpkins, the scarecrows and the Headless Horseman already in the world. It must not be the only source of anything core, and what it drops must be kept after the season ends.
- **The Headless Horseman, as a boss fight:** it already exists as a Halloween-night encounter ([features/halloween-nights.md](../features/halloween-nights.md)). It could gain a lair and a trophy, such as a lantern-headed flail.
- **The Marrow Colossus** (Nether, Marrow Heap): a giant made of bones that sheds parts of itself as it is hurt. Bone-themed trophies would fit the bonecarved style.
- **The Chorus Sovereign** (End, Chorus Reef and Phantom Garden): a crowned shulker-like being that teleports with its arena. It suits levitation or void boons.
- **The Hollow Monarch** (the Pixel Hollows): a retro-game boss with glitching sprites and pixel projectiles. A good fit for the arcade's style.
- **The Kaiser's Zeppelin** (the dieselpunk tiers): an airship fought from a sky platform or the player's own zeppelin. Its weak points are its gondolas.
- **The Frost Wyrm** (Ice Sheet): if the Yeti King is built first, a dragon of the far north for the late game.
- **The Hive Matriarch** (deep caves): an insectoid queen in a hive dungeon, for the underground milestone in [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md).

## Next steps (the owner's choice)

1. Pick the first boss to build. The Yeti King is the owner's own example, and its biomes are built.
2. Write its feature record (template: [features/TEMPLATE.md](../features/TEMPLATE.md)) with the arena, attacks, scaling, reset and loot rules above.
3. Have its death roll `bosses/<boss>.json` for each player who fought, as the trophies expect.
