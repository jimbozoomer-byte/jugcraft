# Chemistry branch

Status: **in progress.** The petrochemistry (oil) line below is being built in batches; the rest of the branch is still planned. This document reserves the branch's scope so mechanical and fluid work stays out of it. See [../TECH_TREE.md](../TECH_TREE.md) for how it fits with the rest of Jugcraft.

## Owner planning: mineral sands and shared refining

The [starter gas and acid factory record](../features/industrial-starter-gas-and-acid-factory.md) now records the eighth batch's ten A choices, including smaller steel/basic-circuit entry machines, selected Separator/nickel costs, automatic heat, full first industrial-acid chain, distinct water/lye overflow defaults, one residue and provisional processing/generator rates. Current aluminum-cable/titanium gates need reachable starter alternatives. Other construction/unit/upgrade-limit proposals and the next eight catalyst/coal questions remain pending; these selections implement no gameplay.

The [mineral-sands and refining plan](../features/mineral-sands-and-refining-plan.md) records dedicated plentiful regional sands as a major industrial supply, hybrid finite-deposit extraction, moderate physical separation and shared chemical machines with distinct roles. Proposed recipes and equipment remain planning work.

Rare-earth development starts with named neodymium, cerium and yttrium products. **Expansion beyond this initial set is explicitly planned at the owner's request; three materials are not the final roster.** Add further named materials alongside useful consumers and reachable recovery routes, following the plan's expansion criteria.

## Owner-selected industrial expansion (7 October 2026)

The independent [industrial chemistry, gas fuels and advanced materials plan](../features/industrial-chemistry-and-fuels-plan.md) records the owner's detailed requests and eight planning batches. Substantial chemistry begins with **steel-built electrical equipment**. The first delivery milestone is a starter gas/acid factory; magnesium, aluminum and titanium follow. Shared stations support more process-specific reagents, meaningful purity grades, useful polymer/ceramic products and mostly larger general-purpose batteries with a few specialty options. Entry aluminum equipment uses earlier copper conductors, with aluminum improvements later.

Selected fuel branches include water electrolysis and a **shared hydrogen/methane gas-burning generator**, plus a **separate lower-output Bio-Generator for cleaned biogas and bioethanol**. Methane improves electricity per tank and upgraded gas-generator output. Catalytic synthesis uses an initial reusable nickel/ceramic bed; gas pipes handle pressurization automatically, without player-managed compressors or pressure settings. Earlier polluting coal gasification yields a CO/hydrogen mixture for cleanup/separation. The first advanced 60/40 biogas digester is a substantial bulk installation. Milling/mashing -> fermentation -> distillation supplies earlier Bio-Generator ethanol, with dehydration for later demanding fuel/blending uses. Optional CO2 capture defaults to continued production/excess venting when full, with optional stop-instead; cement, later breweries and Coke Oven recovery remain useful connections. Filled gas tanks are picked up, placed and pipe-connected using shared storage. Balanced reaction ratios, existing-source distinctions, machine proposals and unresolved costs are in the brief and [TODO](../TODO.md#industrial-chemistry-gas-fuels-and-advanced-materials); these additions are planning, not implemented by that document.

The [material batch](../features/industrial-chemistry-and-fuels-plan.md#material-production-decisions-third-batch) selects distinct titanium treatment/purification/reduction/melting, aluminum electrical/structural/panel/vehicle products, and titanium process-equipment/tool/armor/vehicle/precision products. Plastics extend existing refinery feeds through named intermediates and appropriate HCl connections; one shared Polymer Molding Press uses reusable molds. Ceramic powders become shaped blanks, fired parts and precision-finished products where needed. A small useful alloy set uses compatible upgraded equipment. Compact first refining stations lead to optional larger plants; the separately selected first digester remains substantial. Exact compositions, intermediates, machines, recipes and product statistics still need design.

The [fourth batch](../features/industrial-chemistry-and-fuels-plan.md#products-and-capabilities-fourth-batch) selects magnesium-based titanium refining, stronger titanium tools/armor above steel, aluminum's useful bulk/lightweight roles, initial chemical-equipment steel/aluminum structural alloys, six molding-product families, named ethylene/EDC/vinyl-chloride PVC stages, ceramic families and shared grinding/polishing. General storage develops before portable/specialty banks.

The owner's [complete chemical catalog and routes](../features/industrial-chemical-catalog-and-routes.md) adds the five shared machine roles, sulfuric-acid backbone, fluorite/HF and phosphate wet processing, distinct advanced wafer reagents, food/pharmacy/woodworking connections, HDPE/LDPE/PVAc/PTFE, cobalt-catalyzed synthetic refinery feed, rocket fuel families, LiPF6 and major vanadium flow storage, plus boric and sulfamic applications. Scientific formula/phase corrections and pending detailed recipes are recorded there. Reuse existing machinery and identities; these are planning additions.

The [fifth batch](../features/industrial-chemistry-and-fuels-plan.md#factory-layout-upgrades-and-supplies-fifth-batch) selects upgrade chips/modules and larger advanced machines, ordinary/concentrated/electronic-grade sulfuric supplies, snow-biome fluorite deposits, a cleaner/TMAH/HF first chip core with one photoresist and separate wet-processing/lithography/deposition stations, and a shared Polymer Extruder. Ordinary rotary conversion is separate from upgraded rocket-liquid cryogenics. Vanadium tanks expand capacity and stacks expand charging/output. Industrial fertilizers, refining and polymers precede new optional chemical consumer goods. Exact recipes, capabilities and statistics remain future work.

The [sixth batch](../features/industrial-chemistry-and-fuels-plan.md#materials-and-useful-factory-products-sixth-batch) selects chromium/nickel stainless steel, aluminum-magnesium structural alloy and independent brine/chloride/molten-electrolysis magnesium. Resin/additive preparation makes one photoresist; one advanced chip feeds speed/efficiency/automation upgrades. PTFE supplies processing seals/fittings/liners, nitrogen/phosphate fertilizers have distinct crop applications and optional blends, and one shared purification station supplies demanding reagents. Larger machines improve throughput and energy per unit; useful small stations remain. Underground snow-biome fluorite has occasional surface discovery outcrops. Exact recipes, inputs, effects and generation settings remain future work.

The [seventh batch](../features/industrial-chemistry-and-fuels-plan.md#starter-resources-operation-and-delivery-seventh-batch) selects coastal seawater for magnesium brine, regional chromium ore, water conditioning inside recipes, and PTFE parts in advanced-machine construction rather than lining retrofits. Speed raises throughput/power draw; efficiency reduces energy per batch. First automation adds recipe priorities/stock targets, with remote controls later; fertilizers use broad crop groups and mixed-farm blends. The [first gas/acid factory map](../features/industrial-chemistry-and-fuels-plan.md#first-delivery-milestone-starter-gas-and-acid-factory) connects electrolysis, gas preparation, synthesis/acids, tanks and usable fuels before metal expansion. Exact recipes, source settings, costs and limits remain future work.

## What belongs here

- rare-earth separation;
- battery chemistry.

## Existing items waiting for chemistry

These materials already exist and are obtainable. Chemistry will give them their real uses and replace the temporary stand-ins without changing any item IDs.

## Petrochemistry: the dieselpunk oil line

The owner asked on 1 October 2026 for "the Diesel Punk Chemistry branch of the science tree": crude oil processed into more advanced, usable fuels in big machines, with oil fracking, opening "a new path for more advance power generation and other techs that will be useful for industry later on". It is planned as 20 commits, built five at a time (one PR per batch). Each batch lists what it adds; the status column is updated as batches merge.

Every machine here is steel tier or later and follows [ART_DIRECTION.md](../ART_DIRECTION.md): dieselpunk, detailed, and as big as the real thing (pumpjacks, towers and rigs are multi-block). Fluids move in the existing pipes and tanks. Amounts are millibuckets (mB).

### Batch 1: oil in the world (done, #47)

| # | Commit | What it adds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Crude oil fluid | Liquid crude oil: a real fluid with a bucket, placeable and flowing, that works in every Jugcraft and Fabric tank and pipe. |
| 2 | Fluid processing machines | Machines with several input and output tanks, data-driven fluid recipes (`jugcraft:<machine>` recipe types with fluids in and out), tank gauges on the machine screen, and output tanks that push into pipes. The base for every machine below. |
| 3 | Oil reservoirs | Hidden underground oil fields fixed by the world seed: some chunks hold a conventional reservoir (pumpable), more hold tight shale oil (needs fracking). Each is finite and its depletion is saved. The prospector reports oil in its survey. |
| 4 | Pumpjack | A 3-block-long, 3-tall dieselpunk pumpjack (nodding donkey) that pumps a chunk's conventional reservoir dry, slowly, on JE. |
| 5 | Oil sand extractor | Hot-water extraction: oil sand + water → crude oil + sand. A route to crude anywhere oil sand is found, for players with no reservoir nearby. |

### Batch 2: refining (done, #49)

| # | Commit | What it adds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | Steel pipes and the heavy pump | Higher-throughput steel fluid pipes and a steel pump, sized for refinery flows. |
| 7 | Distillation tower | A tall multi-block column: crude oil → refinery gas, naphtha, diesel and heavy fuel oil, in fixed fractions that conserve volume. |
| 8 | Catalytic cracker | Heavy fuel oil + steam → more diesel, naphtha and gas, with a slowly used catalyst. |
| 9 | Vacuum distillation | Heavy fuel oil → lubricant and asphalt binder. |
| 10 | Reformer | Naphtha → high-octane gasoline. |

### Batch 3: fracking and diesel power (done, #50)

| # | Commit | What it adds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 11 | Chemical mixer and fracking fluid | Water + sand + a gelling agent → fracking fluid. |
| 12 | Fracking rig | A big derrick that pumps fracking fluid into a shale reservoir and brings up crude oil, refinery gas and flowback water. |
| 13 | Flowback treatment | Flowback water → clean water (with losses) and salt, so fracking water is not free. |
| 14 | Diesel generator | A big engine that burns diesel (or heavy fuel oil, less well) for high JE output. |
| 15 | Gas turbine | Burns refinery gas or gasoline for the highest output, with lubricant upkeep. |

### Batch 4: industry (done, #51)

| # | Commit | What it adds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | Plastics | Refinery gas → plastic pellets → plastic sheets, for later machines and parts. |
| 17 | Asphalt | Asphalt binder + gravel → asphalt road blocks that are quicker to walk on. |
| 18 | Diesel engine | A kinetic engine that turns shafts on diesel. |
| 19 | Handbook, advancements and JEI | The oil chapter, advancements, recipe viewer categories and the oil energy audit in [BALANCE.md](../BALANCE.md). |
| 20 | Visual polish | In-game screenshots of the oil machines and a power-gear scene. The owner's restyle of the cables and power gear (the electric look, [ART_DIRECTION.md](../ART_DIRECTION.md#electric-power-gear-and-the-high-tech-tiers)) rode along in this batch. The animated pumpjack and rig and flare stacks were not done: they need a block-entity renderer like the kinetic rotors, and are left for a later polish pass. |

## Industrial chemistry: electrochemistry and acids

After the oil line (owner request, 1 October 2026: "start the next batch immediately"), the branch turns to the items that have been waiting for chemistry since the start: salt, sulfur, phosphate and bauxite. These machines are steel tier and dieselpunk like the oil line, and they use the same fluid machine system, tanks and pipes.

### Batch 5: electrochemistry and acids (done, #52)

| # | Commit | What it adds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 21 | Brine and the electrolytic cell | Salt + water → brine (chemical mixer). A big electrolytic cell splits brine into chlorine gas, hydrogen gas and lye (sodium hydroxide solution). |
| 22 | Sulfuric acid | A chemical reactor: sulfur dust + water → sulfuric acid, the base of the acid chemistry. |
| 23 | Alumina and real aluminum | Bauxite digested in hot lye → alumina (the Bayer process); the electrolytic cell smelts alumina with a coke anode into aluminum, far better than the blast-furnace stand-in. |
| 24 | Fertilizer | Phosphate + sulfuric acid → fertilizer: a stronger bone meal that ripens crops around it, for the farming pillar. |
| 25 | Hydrogen fuel cell | Hydrogen → JE in a fuel cell (the first electric-look generator), so the cell's byproducts pay for some of its power; handbook, advancements and docs. |

### Batch 6: advanced materials

Owner request, 1 October 2026: "start the next batch with 1 and 2" (chlorine and titanium; batteries and rare earths). Status: implemented in #54; see [industrial-chemistry.md](../features/industrial-chemistry.md).

| # | Commit | What it adds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 26 | Titanium ore | Titanium: a new metal, mined as rutile-bearing ore deep underground. No furnace smelts it. |
| 27 | The Kroll process | Raw titanium + coke + chlorine → titanium sponge (chemical reactor) → ingots in the arc furnace: chlorine's first real job. Titanium goes into the lithium battery bank. |
| 28 | Lithium and rare earths | Lepidolite and monazite leached in sulfuric acid: twice what the blast-furnace stand-ins give. |
| 29 | Lithium battery bank | Lithium cells and a big electric-look battery bank, far above the capacitor bank. |
| 30 | Rare-earth magnets | Neodymium magnets; a magnet dynamo and a magnet motor that lose far less than the copper-wound ones; docs and advancements. |

### Batch 12: nitrogen chemistry

The first batch from the owner's saved idea backlog ([MACHINE_ROADMAP.md](../MACHINE_ROADMAP.md#idea-backlog-saved-by-the-owner-1-october-2026)). Feature record: [nitrogen-chemistry.md](../features/nitrogen-chemistry.md).

| # | What it adds |
| --- | --- |
| 31 | Air separation unit: a 2×2×6 cold box that splits air into nitrogen (top) and oxygen (base), four parts to one, needing only power. Nitrogen, oxygen and ammonia gases. |
| 32 | Synthesis converter: a 3×4×2 high-pressure loop. Haber–Bosch (hydrogen + nitrogen → ammonia) and Ostwald (ammonia + oxygen + water → nitric acid). Nitric acid fluid. |
| 33 | Uses: ammonia + phosphate → ammonium phosphate fertilizer (6 for 2 phosphate); nitric acid etches microchips with half the acid. Handbook, advancements and docs. |

### Batch 13: oxygen-blown steel and argon

| # | What it adds |
| --- | --- |
| 34 | The air separation unit also gives argon (1 mB every 2 ticks, from the middle of the column). Item machines can take a **boost gas**: oxygen blown into the steel foundry and argon round the crystal grower's melt double their speed, burning the gas each tick they are boosted. |

### Batch 14: rubber and polymers

| # | What it adds |
| --- | --- |
| 35 | Butadiene gas from naphtha (chemical reactor), synthetic rubber from butadiene (polymerization reactor), gaskets. Rubber belts and gasketed steel pipe. Feature record: [rubber.md](../features/rubber.md). |

### Batch 15: chlorine and lye

| # | What it adds |
| --- | --- |
| 36 | Vinyl chloride (refinery gas + chlorine, synthesis converter) → PVC resin (polymerization reactor) → two plastic sheets each (metal press). Soap from lye and rotten flesh (chemical reactor), which washes off status effects. Feature record: [chlor-alkali.md](../features/chlor-alkali.md). |

### Batch 16: glass chemistry

| # | What it adds |
| --- | --- |
| 37 | Tincal (desert borax crust), borax, borosilicate glass, optical fibre and ferroboron. Fibre stands in for gold in processors; ferroboron doubles neodymium magnets. Multi-input recipes now try the one with the most ingredients first. Feature record: [glass-chemistry.md](../features/glass-chemistry.md). |

### Rules for the oil line

- **Oil is finite.** Reservoirs run dry and oil sand is an ore; nothing turns power back into crude. Every fuel's JE per bucket is set so refining pays off over burning raw bitumen, and the full chain is audited in BALANCE.md (commit 19).
- **Reachable everywhere.** A player with no reservoir can still get crude from oil sand (commit 5), and shale (fracking) is common where conventional oil is not.
- **Volume is conserved** through refining: the fractions of one bucket of crude add up to one bucket or less.

## Waste recovery and pollution planning

The owner's [step 6 plan](../features/waste-recycling-and-pollution-plan.md) chooses optional initial recovery and equipment disassembly. Pollution replaces random automatic raids; higher thresholds unlock stronger marauder parties. It concentrates locally, spreads modestly nearby and naturally declines, with readings on a map device and no landscape appearance changes. Proposed shared equipment includes filtration/settling, selected neutralization, reagent recovery and compatible emissions scrubbing. Numeric balance, scheduler details, equipment and recipes remain to be developed; this is not implemented gameplay or a blanket mandatory waste-treatment requirement.

## Boundaries

- **Fluids** (pipes, tanks, pumps) belong to the fluid system; chemistry only uses them.
- **Mechanical machines** (crusher, press, drawer, alloy smelter, assembler) stay mechanical. Alloying is physical mixing, so it stays in the mechanical branch.
- **No free resources.** Every reaction will be audited like the existing recipes: defined units, losses allowed, gains not.
