# What exists in Jugcraft

A map of everything built so far, written for AI agents and contributors who need to add features **alongside** or **on top of** the existing systems. It lists content, the shared APIs to call, the data formats, where each thing lives, and the rules the checks enforce.

- Player-facing explanations: [TECH_TREE.md](TECH_TREE.md).
- Per-feature records: [features/](features/).
- History of changes: [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

> **Status.** Everything here compiles and loads in CI. Where a feature has an automated game test, that test passes on a headless server. Nothing has been play-tested in a client or on a dedicated server with two players yet.
>
> This document describes `main` after PRs #4–#36 (the conveyors and powered tools of #38 and #40 are not described here yet), plus the Agriculture branch's Fall Harvest, Kitchen Garden, Festival Crops, pumpkin carving, Halloween harvest, the pumpkin regatta and trick-or-treating, the Halloween festivities, Halloween nights, the thirty Halloween decorations, and more Halloween: the haunted house inside, the mad scientist and monsters, the yard and porch, lighting and glow, party games, night events, treats, and costumes; and the fall additions: the chandlery, the cider mill, the preserves pantry, crows and working scarecrows, spooky fireworks, the sky lantern festival, the Harvest Feast Table, the corn maze, ghost hunting, and face paint; and the more fall additions: the candy kitchen, autumn foraging, the Bat House, the Hay Golem, knitting, pie baking, the Spirit Board, wild turkeys, the theremin and the Día de Muertos ofrenda. Update it whenever you add, rename or remove a system, so it stays the map other contributors rely on.

## Quick facts

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Platform | Minecraft Java 26.3, Fabric Loader 0.19.3, Fabric API 0.161.0+26.3, Loom 1.17, JDK 25 (pins in [PLATFORM.md](PLATFORM.md); do not change them without a platform PR) |
| Mod ID / namespace | `jugcraft` (`Jugcraft.MOD_ID`, `Jugcraft.id(path)`) |
| Java package | `io.github.jimbozoomer.jugcraft` |
| Mappings | Mojang names (e.g. `Identifier`, `BlockEntity`, `AbstractContainerMenu`) |
| Energy unit | **JE** (Jugcraft Energy), `long`, per tick |
| Fluid unit | **mB** in Jugcraft numbers. Fabric counts droplets: `FluidNetworks.DROPLETS_PER_MB` = 81 |
| Metal accounting | nugget units: nugget 1, ingot/raw/ore/dust/washed ore/plate 9, wire 3, gear 36, block 81 |
| Authority | All logic runs on the server; screens only show synced `ContainerData` |
| Registered IDs | 1015 items/blocks under `jugcraft:` (the checker counts them), plus the entities `pumpkin_barge`, `pumpkin_racer`, `will_o_wisp`, `flying_pumpkin`, `throw_marker`, `headless_horseman`, `flaming_pumpkin`, `bowling_pumpkin`, `toilet_paper_roll`, `haunted_hayride`, `crow`, `spooky_rocket`, `sky_lantern`, `restless_spirit` and `hay_golem`, plus the `jugcraft:pixel_hollows` biome and the `jugcraft:retro_trader` villager profession |

## Build, generate, check

Most JSON (models, blockstates, lang, loot, recipes, tags, worldgen) and every texture are **generated**. Edit the Python source of truth, not the JSON.

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 tools/generate_textures.py` | Draws every texture (original pixel art, deterministic seeds) |
| `python3 tools/generate_material_data.py` | Writes all generated JSON, both machine styles and the built-in alternate pack |
| `python3 tools/check_mod_data.py` | Offline audit: IDs, assets, loot, tags, worldgen, recipe metal balance, Python ↔ Java sync |
| `python scripts/check_repository.py` | Repository structure and Markdown links |
| `./gradlew build` | Compiles and runs the **game tests** on a headless server (needs Fabric/Mojang Maven access; CI has it) |

CI runs all of these and fails if generated files are out of date.

## Content inventory

### Materials (`materials/`, `tools/materials.py`)

| Metal | Forms | Source | Feature switch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tin, zinc, lead, silver, nickel, tungsten, uranium | ore, deepslate ore, raw, raw block, ingot, nugget, block | worldgen ores | own name (`tin`, `zinc`, …) |
| aluminum | ingot, nugget, block | bauxite (arc furnace; blast-furnace stand-in gives a nugget) | `aluminum` |
| bronze | ingot, nugget, block, `bronze_blend` | 3 copper + 1 tin (hand blend or alloy smelter) | `tin` |
| brass, invar, solder | ingot, nugget, block | alloy smelter only | `zinc`, `nickel`, `lead` |
| steel | ingot, nugget, block; plate, gear | steel foundry (iron + coke) | `machines` |

| Other | IDs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minerals | `salt`, `phosphate`, `lepidolite`, `monazite` (+ `_ore`, `deepslate_…_ore`, `…_block`) | ores drop several items |
| Rocks | `bauxite` (block), `oil_sand` (block, drops `bitumen`) | biome-limited surface worldgen |
| Items | `bitumen`, `sulfur_dust`, `silicon`, `lithium_carbonate`, `rare_earth_oxide`, `coke` (`c:coal_coke`) | several are chemistry stand-ins; coke is fuel and steel's carbon |
| Components | `<metal>_plate` ×11, `<metal>_gear` ×5, `<metal>_wire` ×3, `basic_circuit`, `advanced_circuit` | `JugcraftComponents`; tags `c:plates/…`, `c:gears/…`, `c:wires/…` |
| Ore processing | `<metal>_dust` ×10 (copper, iron, gold, tin, zinc, lead, silver, nickel, tungsten, uranium), `washed_<metal>_ore` ×10, `sawdust` | tags `c:dusts/<metal>` |

Every Jugcraft metal and part carries `c:` convention tags (`c:ingots/tin`, `c:ores/tin`, `c:raw_materials/tin`, `c:storage_blocks/tin`, `c:nuggets/tin`, `c:dusts/tin`, …). **Use tags in recipes** so other mods' equivalents work.

### Machines (`machine/MachineKind`)

Every machine is one `MachineBlock` + `MachineBlockEntity` whose behavior comes from its `MachineKind`.

- **Slot order:** inputs, the output, any byproduct slots, then (powered processors only) two upgrade slots.
- `kind.slots` ends before the upgrade slots, and `kind.containerSize()` includes them.

## Shared systems and how to plug in

### Diagonal connections (`diagonal/`, `tools/diagonal_connections.py`)
Every `FenceBlock` and `IronBarsBlock` has the properties `north_east`, `south_east`, `south_west` and `north_west`; only blocks in `#jugcraft:connects_diagonally` set them. To make a new fence, pane or bars block join diagonally, add it to `tools/diagonal_connections.py`. The generator writes its 45-degree arm model (a child of its side model) and its four blockstate parts, and tags it; `check_diagonal_connections` fails if a fence-shaped Jugcraft blockstate is left out. Record: [diagonal-connections.md](features/diagonal-connections.md).

### Energy (`energy/`)

- **Interface:** `EnergyStorage` has `insert`/`extract` in Fabric transactions, plus `getAmount` and `getCapacity`.
- **Lookup:** `EnergyStorage.SIDED` is a `BlockApiLookup<EnergyStorage, Direction>` with ID `jugcraft:energy`.
  - **To make any block take or give power, register a provider on `EnergyStorage.SIDED`.** Cables, generators and machines then connect automatically, and cables draw a connection arm to it.
- **Base implementation:** `SimpleEnergyStorage(capacity, maxInsert, maxExtract, onChange)`, with `setAmount` for tests and loading.
- **Pushing:** `EnergyNetworks.pushToNeighbors(level, pos, source, maxAmount, sides)` sends into adjacent storages and cable networks. `EnergyNetworks.move(from, to, max)` is transactional.
- **Belts:** discovery follows a pulley's `link` to its partner and continues both ways along the partner's axis.
- **Caching:** networks are cached per level. Call `EnergyNetworks.invalidate(level)` when cable layout changes. There are at most 2,048 cables per network.
- **Tiers:** `CableBlock(properties, rate)`. A network's rate is the minimum `transferRate()` of its cables.
- **Marker:** `EnergyConnectable` marks blocks cables always connect to (cables, generators, machines). Other blocks connect through the lookup alone.
- **Rule:** use this one energy system for anything that uses or stores power (CLAUDE.md: no incompatible power systems).
  - Kinetic power (below) is a compatible layer, not a second currency: every JE machine takes KE 1:1 through `KineticConsumer`, and the dynamo bridges KE into JE. New machines should use `EnergyStorage`; they then run off shafts automatically.

### Kinetic power (`kinetic/`)

- **KE per tick**, carried by `ShaftBlock` (along its axis) and `GearboxBlock` (all sides). A source calls `KineticNetworks.push(level, pos, side, amount)`, which splits power evenly between the `KineticConsumer`s at the ends of the line.
- **Consumers:** `MachineBlockEntity` (as JE, up to `kind.maxInput`, for any powered non-generator, non-battery kind, reached through any block of a multi-block) and `DynamoBlockEntity` (KE → JE at 75%).
- **Caching:** networks are cached per (source, side) and level. Shafts, gearboxes, sources and the dynamo call `KineticNetworks.invalidate(level)` when placed, removed or their neighbors change. There are at most 256 parts per network.
- **Turning look:** `ShaftBlock.TURNING`, set by the network with client-only updates and cleared by a scheduled tick 10–20 ticks after the last push. While it is set (or a steam engine is `lit`), the block's `_active` model leaves out its rotor and client `KineticRotorRenderer` (via `KineticRotors`) draws it spinning, from `assets/jugcraft/kinetic_rotors.json` (exported by `tools/kinetic_rotors.py` from `kinetic_models.ROTORS`). `ShaftBlockEntity` holds no data; it exists only for the renderer.

### Fluids (`fluid/`)

- Uses **Fabric's** `FluidStorage.SIDED` and `Storage<FluidVariant>`. Any block exposing it works with pipes, pumps and buckets.
- `FluidNetworks.pushToNeighbors(level, pos, source, maxDroplets, sides)` pushes. Networks are cached (`invalidate(level)`), with at most 1,024 pipes. The marker is `FluidConnectable`.
- **Only pumps (and generators pushing out) move fluid.** Pipes and tanks are passive.
- **Steel tank:** a `MachineKind` with a full `SingleFluidStorage` (`reservoir()`), returned by `fluidFor(side)` on every block.
- **Machine tanks:** `MachineBlockEntity` has one `tank` (mB, saved as `"water"`) exposed through `fluidFor(side)`.
  - Kinds with a tank: steam generator (water), geothermal generator (lava), ore washer (water). Capacity is `MachineKind.tankCapacity()`.
  - A water source block directly below the steam generator or ore washer is a spring: 20 mB/t, never used up.

### Oil and fluid processing (`chemistry/`, `tools/petro.py`)

- **Petroleum fluids** (`PetroFluids`): `Entry` per fluid with source, flowing, `LiquidBlock` and bucket; `OilFluid` never makes new sources. Client: `PetroFluidsClient` registers the still/flow textures. Fluid tags `c:<fluid>`.
- **Fluid processing machines:** a `MachineKind` with a `fluidSpec()` (`FluidMachineSpec`: input and output tank capacities, item inputs and outputs). `MachineBlockEntity.tanks()` is a `FluidTanks`; `fluidFor(side)` exposes all tanks as one storage (inputs insert-only and filtered by recipes, outputs extract-only). Output tanks push out of every outer face every 4 ticks.
- **Fluid recipes** (`FluidRecipe`, `FluidRecipes`): one recipe type per machine (`MachineKind.recipeType()`), JSON keys `items`, `fluids`, `fluid_results`, `results`, `time`. Written from `tools/petro.py`; `check_mod_data.py` audits them and forbids fluid from nothing (`source` declares fluid released from items).
- **Oil reservoirs** (`OilReservoirs`): seeded per chunk, `get(level, chunk)` and `extract(level, chunk, kind, mb)`; depletion is `SavedData` (`jugcraft:oil_reservoirs`). `overrideForTest` is for game tests only.
- **Gases** (`PetroFluids.Gas`, `GasFluid`): fluids with no block or bucket (refinery gas); Fabric names them from `block.<ns>.<id>`.
- **Draw-offs:** `MachineKind.outputLayer(tank)` makes an output tank push only from the faces of one block layer (distillation tower, cracker, reformer).
- **Items** (`PetroItems`): cracking catalyst, asphalt binder.
- **Machines:** `PUMPJACK` (custom tick), `DISTILLATION_TOWER` (`distillation`: crude oil, and heavy fuel oil vacuum-distilled since batch 24), `CATALYTIC_CRACKER` (`catalytic_cracking`: cracking, and naphtha reforming since batch 24), `FRACKING_RIG` (custom tick; works over shale), `FLOWBACK_TREATMENT_UNIT` (`water_treatment`; the Settling Plant: flowback water, oil sand, bitumen, mud). The oil sand extractor, vacuum distillation unit, catalytic reformer and chemical mixer were removed in batch 24 (docs/features/machine-consolidation.md).
- **Fluid results** may name their output tank (`"tank": n`, `FluidRecipe.resultTank`); without it they go by position.
- **Industrial chemistry:** `ELECTROLYTIC_CELL` (`electrolysis`: brine → chlorine/hydrogen/lye by layer; alumina + coke → aluminum), `CHEMICAL_REACTOR` (`chemical_reaction`: sulfuric acid, alumina, fertilizer), `FUEL_CELL` (hydrogen → JE). Items `alumina`, `fertilizer`, `titanium_sponge`, `lithium_cell`, `neodymium_magnet`, and the electronics items `silicon_boule`, `silicon_wafer`, `microchip` (`chemistry/FertilizerItem`, area bone meal on crops). Fluids `brine`, `lye`, `sulfuric_acid`; gases `chlorine`, `hydrogen`. `check_mod_data` audits metal in fluid recipes.
- **Nitrogen chemistry (batch 12):** `AIR_SEPARATION_UNIT` (no recipes, like the pumpjack: `tickAirSeparation` fills nitrogen `ASU_NITROGEN_PER_TICK` into tank 0, drawn off layer 5, and oxygen `ASU_OXYGEN_PER_TICK` into tank 1, layer 0) and `SYNTHESIS_CONVERTER` (`gas_synthesis`: Haber–Bosch ammonia, Ostwald nitric acid; three input tanks, one output). Gases `nitrogen`, `oxygen`, `ammonia`; fluid `nitric_acid`. Chemical reactor `ammonium_phosphate` and lithography `microchip_nitric` recipes.
- **Glass chemistry (batch 16):** rock `tincal` (`ROCKS`, desert/badlands, drops `borax`); items `borax`, `borosilicate_glass`, `optical_fibre`, `ferroboron` (`materials.ITEMS`). Machine recipes may set `"name"` for a second recipe with the same output. `MachineRecipes.multiRecipes` sorts by ingredient count, most first.
- **Machine screens (batch 22):** `client/MachineScreen` is 268 wide: the 176-wide bay and inventory (slot positions unchanged) and a terminal (tagline, status, progress, power, rate, condition, side controls). Themes and colours come from `assets/jugcraft/gui/machine_themes.json` (`client/MachineScreenThemes`), written with the backgrounds and taglines by `tools/gui_textures.py`.
- **Solar thermal (batch 21):** package `solar`: `SOLAR_TRACKER` (`SolarTrackerBlockEntity`, generator), `HELIOSTAT` (`HeliostatBlockEntity`, empty, for the renderer), `SOLAR_RECEIVER` (`SolarReceiverBlockEntity`: `countHeliostats`, water tank, `JE_PER_HELIOSTAT`, `MAX_HELIOSTATS`, `JE_PER_MB`). `SunTrackingBlock` keeps `turning` true so the client draws the top part; rotors in `kinetic_models.ROTORS` with `"mode": "sun"` tilt with the day time (`client/KineticRotors`). Their models are built with the kinetic blocks (`KINETIC_BLOCKS`).
- **Joined tanks and gauges (batch 20):** `fluid/TankGroup` (a `CombinedStorage` over face-joined `FluidTankBlockEntity`s, lowest first, one fluid, drains from the top) is what `FluidStorage.SIDED`, buckets and comparators get for a tank. `GLASS_TANK` shares the tank block entity and syncs its fluid to clients (`client/GlassTankRenderer`). `TANK_GAUGE` (`fluid/TankGaugeBlock`): `FACING`, `LEVEL` 0-8, reads `FluidStorage.SIDED` behind it every 10 ticks. Assets in `tools/tank_display.py`.
- **Turbocharger and flywheel (batch 19):** item `turbocharger` (`PetroItems`); the advanced engine has one item slot (turbocharger only, `canPlaceItem`) and a coolant tank (input 1, water); `tickDieselEngine` uses `TURBO_OUTPUT`, `TURBO_EFFICIENCY_PERCENT` and `TURBO_WATER_PER_TICK`. Block `flywheel` (`kinetic/FlywheelBlock`, `FlywheelBlockEntity`: a `KineticConsumer` on every face but its front, pushes from its front; `CAPACITY`, `RATE`, `FRICTION_DIVISOR`).
- **Explosive weapons (batch 18):** package `weapons`: `JugcraftWeapons.GRENADE` (entity type), `GrenadeEntity` (a `ThrowableItemProjectile` that calls `Blast.detonate` on hit), `GrenadeItem`, `GrenadeLauncherItem`, and `Blast` (damage to `LivingEntity` only, falloff and `ServerExplosion.getSeenPercent` shielding, never touches blocks). Items `guncotton`, `grenade`, `grenade_launcher` (`PetroItems`). Feature switch `explosives`.
- **Flow batteries (batch 17):** fluid `vanadium_electrolyte` (chemical reactor); `FLOW_BATTERY` is a battery (`isBattery`, `keepsContents`) whose reservoir takes only electrolyte and cannot be extracted from. `SimpleEnergyStorage` takes an optional ceiling (`LongSupplier`); the flow battery's is electrolyte mB × `FLOW_BATTERY_JE_PER_MB`. `loadAdditional` reads the reservoir before the energy.
- **Chlor-alkali (batch 15):** gas `vinyl_chloride`; items `pvc_resin`, `soap` (`chemistry/SoapItem`: use to clear status effects).
- **Rubber (batch 14):** gas `butadiene`; items `rubber`, `gasket` (`PetroItems`); `ALT_CRAFTING` in `tools/machines.py` holds second recipes (`belt_from_rubber`, `steel_fluid_pipe_from_gaskets`).
- **Boost gases (batch 13):** `MachineKind.boostGas()` / `boostPerTick()`: the steel foundry (oxygen) and crystal grower (argon) get a `TankInlet` for the gas; `tickProcessor` takes a second step each tick it can burn `boostPerTick` mB. The air separation unit's third tank is argon (`ASU_ARGON_INTERVAL`). Gas `argon`.
- **Fluid generators:** `DIESEL_GENERATOR`, `GAS_TURBINE` and `FUEL_CELL` burn fuel from input tank 0 (`MachineBlockEntity.tickFluidGenerator`); JE per mB is `FluidFuels.jePerMb(kind, fluid)` (mirrored in `tools/petro.py` `FLUID_FUELS`). The turbine's tank 1 holds lubricant, used 1 mB per `FluidFuels.LUBRICANT_TICKS`.
- **Gas storage (batch 35):** `fluid/GasCylinderItem` (`JugcraftFluids.GAS_CYLINDER`; contents in `jugcraft:stored_fluid`; a `FluidStorage.ITEM` provider built on `ContainerItemContext.exchange`, gases only). `MachineKind.AMMONIA_CHILLER` is a fluid processor (`chilling` recipes; ammonia tank 0, water tank 1). Numbers, recipes and the HD cylinder art: `tools/gas_storage.py` (merged into `tools/petro.py`'s fluid machines). Record: [gas-storage.md](features/gas-storage.md).
- **Electroplating (batch 34):** `MachineKind.ELECTROPLATING_BATH` (processor with its own `MachineBlockEntity.tickElectroplating`, no recipes; a `TankInlet` of `sulfuric_acid`). `machine/Electroplating` holds the numbers, the `jugcraft:plating` item component and `plate`/`metalOf`/`wearsGold`; `mixin/PiglinSafeArmorMixin` makes gold plating count for piglins; the tooltip is in `JugcraftClient`. Numbers and lang: `tools/electroplating.py`. Record: [electroplating.md](features/electroplating.md).
- **Hydroponics (batch 33):** `MachineKind.HYDROPONIC_BAY` (processor, `hydroponics` recipes, a `TankInlet` of `nutrient_solution`, `HYDROPONIC_SOLUTION_PER_HARVEST` taken when a harvest finishes; byproduct slots return the seed). Fluid `nutrient_solution` (`PetroFluids`); its chemical reactor recipe in `tools/petro.py`. Crop table: `tools/hydroponics.py`. Record: [hydroponics.md](features/hydroponics.md).
- **Construction chemistry (batch 32):** `chemistry/ConstructionChemistry` (numbers; blocks `construction_foam`, `concrete`, `blastproof_concrete` and their `_slab`/`_stairs`; items `cement_mix`, `cement`, `rebar`, `foam_canister` (durability = foam), `foam_sprayer`). `FoamSprayerItem.fill` is a nearest-first flood fill through replaceable blocks, checked against `mayInteract`, `mayUseItemAt` and `TownProtection.denies`. `CementItem` turns foam into concrete. Data and art: `tools/construction.py`. Record: [construction-chemistry.md](features/construction-chemistry.md).
- **Field chemistry (batch 31):** `weapons/FieldChemistry` (numbers, items, damage type keys `jugcraft:chlorine`/`thermite`, entity `chemical_cloud`, `breathesFiltered` for the gas mask and sealed scuba set, `mayAffect` for PvP and parties). `GrenadeItem` carries a `Warhead` (FRAG, CHLORINE, SMOKE, THERMITE, FLASHBANG); `GrenadeEntity` detonates its item's warhead; the launcher fires any `GrenadeItem`. `ChemicalCloud` (not saved; pulses every 20 ticks; smoke sweeps targets every 5), `Flash` (instant). Medicines are plain items with vanilla `consumable` components. Data and art: `tools/field_chemistry.py`; reactor recipes in `tools/petro.py`. Record: [field-chemistry.md](features/field-chemistry.md).
- **Pneumatic grapple (batch 30):** `gear/JugcraftGrapple` (numbers, the `jugcraft:nitrogen` item component, item `pneumatic_grapple`, entity `grapple_hook`), `PneumaticGrappleItem` (fills from Fabric fluid storage like the scuba tank; fires or lets go), `GrappleHook` (a `ThrowableItemProjectile` with synced `ANCHORED` and `HOOKED`; server-side reel and drag, sending the owner `ClientboundSetEntityMotionPacket`; one hook per player via `GrappleHook.active`), client `GrappleHookRenderer`. Data and art: `tools/grapple.py`. Record: [pneumatic-grapple.md](features/pneumatic-grapple.md).
- **Refinery upgrades (batch 29):** fluids `premium_diesel`, `premium_gasoline`; gas `hydrogen_sulfide`. `HYDROTREATER` (`hydrotreating` recipes, two input and two output tanks, no item slots; outputs drawn off by layer, `HYDROTREATER_DRAW_OFFS`). The chemical reactor's `sulfur_recovery` recipe turns hydrogen sulfide into sulfur dust. `HEAT_RECOVERY_UNIT` (`MachineBlockEntity.tickHeatRecovery`): a generator with water (tank 0, or a spring below) and lubricant (tank 1). Diesel generators and gas turbines bank their output as `exhaust` (at most two ticks' worth, not saved) and the unit takes it with `takeExhaust`, making `MachineKind.RECOVERY_PERCENT` of it as JE; so units share, never double, one generator's heat. Record: [refinery-upgrades.md](features/refinery-upgrades.md).
- **Pumps and pipes:** `ElectricPumpBlockEntity.Tier` (ELECTRIC, HEAVY); `FluidPipeBlock` takes a rate (bronze 250, steel 1,000 mB/t) and a network carries its slowest pipe's rate.

### Items (`logistics/`)

- Uses **Fabric's** `ItemStorage.SIDED`. Machines expose their slots via `WorldlyContainer`, following the side configuration.
- `ItemNetworks.push(level, pos, side, source, maxItems, exclude)` pushes out of one side, into a pipe network or directly into the neighbor.
  - Routing sends items to matching sorters first, then round-robin to the other inventories. The pusher and `exclude` never receive.
  - Networks are cached (`invalidate(level)`), with at most 1,024 pipes. The marker is `ItemConnectable`.
- **Side configuration:** `machine/SideConfig` holds per-face `Mode` (INPUT, OUTPUT, BOTH, NONE), relative to the machine's front (`Face.of(side, facing)`), plus an `eject` flag.
  - It is packed into one synced int (`DATA_SIDES`). Menu buttons 0–5 cycle faces and 6 toggles eject (`MachineMenu.clickMenuButton` → `MachineBlockEntity.clickSideButton`).
  - When eject is on, a processor pushes all output and byproduct slots every 8 ticks (16 items).
  - `SideConfig` also holds the **redstone mode** (`Redstone`: IGNORED, HIGH, LOW; button 7), packed into bits 13–14.

### Machines (`machine/`)

- **`MachineKind`** is the single place for a machine's numbers and behavior switches:
  - `isProcessor()`, `isGenerator()`, `isMultiInput()`
  - `recipeType()`, `outputSlot()`, `byproductSlots()`, `tankCapacity()`, `usesPower()`, `upgradeSlots()`, `containerSize()`
  - `footprint()`, `powerPort()`
- **`MachineBlockEntity`** holds energy, items, progress, tank and side config. `serverTick` switches on the kind. Every processor uses `tickProcessor`: find a recipe → check the output and byproduct room (and water for the washer) → use energy → finish.
- **Multi-block machines:** `Footprint` gives the offsets (facing north). `LargeMachineBlock` has a `PART` 0..3 property. Only the master block has the block entity.
  - Breaking any part removes the whole machine. `MachineBlock.machineAt(level, pos, state)` resolves any part to its master.
  - Each block renders its own slice of one big model, which the generator cuts up.
- **Power ports:** `PowerPort(part, face)`. `MachineBlock.acceptsPower(state, side)` combines it with `usesPower()`, and both the energy lookup and the cable arms use that one check. Today only the alloy smelter has a port; the coke oven and steel foundry take no power at all.
- **Screens:** `MachineMenu` (server/common) and `client/MachineScreen` (client only). Slot positions come from `MachineMenu` constants.
- **Fuels:** `GeneratorFuels.burnTicks` and `steamBurnTicks`.
- **Upgrades:** `MachineUpgrades` holds the SPEED and EFFICIENCY items.
  - `effect(slots)` returns an `Effect` with `ticks(base)` and `use(base)`.
  - `MachineBlockEntity.upgrades()` reads a machine's cards.
- **Comparators:** `MachineBlockEntity.comparatorSignal()` returns energy for generators and batteries, and slot fullness for processors. It works from any part.

### Recipes (`machine/MachineRecipe*`, `data/jugcraft/recipe/<type>/`)

Each machine recipe is a normal Minecraft recipe file, so a data pack can add, replace or remove recipes, and `/reload` applies the change.

```json
{"type": "jugcraft:crushing", "ingredient": "#c:ores/tin", "result": {"id": "jugcraft:raw_tin", "count": 2}, "time": 160}

{"type": "jugcraft:alloying",
 "ingredients": [{"ingredient": "minecraft:copper_ingot", "count": 3}, {"ingredient": "#c:ingots/tin", "count": 1}],
 "result": {"id": "jugcraft:bronze_ingot", "count": 4}, "time": 200}

{"type": "jugcraft:pulverizing", "ingredient": "jugcraft:tin_ore", "result": {"id": "jugcraft:tin_dust", "count": 2}, "time": 200,
 "byproducts": [{"result": {"id": "jugcraft:tungsten_dust"}, "chance": 0.05, "feature": "tungsten"}]}
```

- **Single-input format** (`MachineRecipe`): `ingredient`, `result`, `time` (default 200), and optional `byproducts`. Types: crushing, arc_smelting, pressing, wire_drawing, pulverizing, ore_washing, sifting, sawing.
- **Multi-input format** (`MultiMachineRecipe`): `ingredients` is a list of `{ingredient, count}`, matched in any slot order; every other input slot must be empty. Types: alloying, circuit_assembly.
- **Byproducts** (`MachineRecipe.Byproduct`):
  - Each is rolled once per operation.
  - It is skipped if its `feature` switch is off.
  - The machine waits unless every possible byproduct fits in its byproduct slots.
- **Lookup:** use `MachineRecipes.find(serverLevel, kind, stack)` and `findMulti(...)`. Types and serializers are registered per kind in `MachineRecipeTypes`.
- **Resource condition:** `{"condition": "jugcraft:feature_enabled", "feature": "<name>"}` in `fabric:load_conditions` gates any JSON by a feature switch.
- **Recipe viewers:** an optional JEI plugin (`client/compat/JugcraftJeiPlugin`, JEI 31.8 compile-time API) shows one category per machine, read from `assets/jugcraft/recipe_view.json` (`tools/recipe_view.py`). Fluid machines get their own categories with fluid slots (amounts converted with `IPlatformFluidHelper.bucketVolume()`). Refinery gas has a still texture registered so viewers can draw it. EMI and REI have no plugin.

### Crops (`agriculture/`)

- **Growth rules:** `CropGrowth.speed(level, pos, isLegume)`, the vanilla soil formula with no crowding penalty, times `LEGUME_BONUS` (1.5) next to a block in `jugcraft:nitrogen_fixing_crops`. `CropGrowth.chanceDivisor(speed, growthTime)` gives the random-tick odds.
- **Tall crops:** `TallCropBlock.growTo(level, bottom, age)` adds sections (only into air, or only into trellis for a `TallCrop.trellis` crop). `pick(level, bottom, dropPos)` harvests a ripe plant and keeps it standing. `bottom(pos, state)` finds the ticking bottom block from any section. A climbing crop's loot drops one trellis from every section.
- Only the bottom section ticks and has loot, and breaking any section removes the plant. Loot tables use the **26.x format**: singular `condition`, `modifier`, and `minecraft:match_block` with `state` (see `tools/agriculture_data.py`).
- **Lookups:** `JugcraftAgriculture.item(id)` and `block(id)`. `JugcraftAgriculture.TALL_CROPS` holds the tall-crop blocks.
- **Seed sources:** a Fabric loot event adds one pool to vanilla short grass: `GRASS_SEED_CHANCE` (0.125) to drop one seed chosen evenly from `GRASS_SEEDS`. Wild patches are added to biomes by `wildPatch(name, biome tags...)`.
- **Gourds:** `GourdStemBlock.growGourd(level, pos, side)` grows the gourd of a fully grown stem on one side (if that block is air over `minecraft:supports_stem_fruit`) and turns the stem into its `AttachedGourdStemBlock`, which straightens again when the gourd goes. New gourds: a `GOURDS` entry in `tools/agriculture.py`, a `gourd(...)` call and shapes in `JugcraftAgriculture`, and textures in `tools/festival_textures.py`.
- **Cranberries:** `CranberryBushBlock.isShallowWater(level, pos)` is the planting rule; `canGrow(level, pos)` needs air above and light 9; `pick(level, pos, dropPos)` harvests. Bog soil is the block tag `jugcraft:bog_soil`.
- **Chestnuts:** `ChestnutLeavesBlock.canFruit(state, level, pos)` (natural leaves near a log with air below) and `pick(level, pos)`. The sapling grows `worldgen/feature/chestnut.json` through `CHESTNUT_GROWER`. Any axe strips a `StrippableLogBlock` (the block handles the axe itself). The sawmill saws `#jugcraft:chestnut_logs` into 6 planks (`tools/machines.py`).

### Pumpkin carving (`agriculture/PumpkinCarving*`, `CarvedPumpkin*`, `CarvingTemplates`)

- **Design:** `PumpkinCarving` is an immutable design of four 16×16 faces (front, then clockwise seen from above: `faceIndex(facing, side)` and `side(facing, face)`), each pixel `SKIN`, `SHAVED` or `CUT`, a face row being one int of 2-bit pixels. `glow()` gives the light with a torch inside. `CODEC` saves it as an int array; equal designs are equal, so clients share their textures.
- **Carving:** `PumpkinCarvings.open(player, pos, side)` starts a session and sends `OpenCarvingPayload`; the client's `CarvingScreen` sends back a `CarvePayload` (exactly 16 rows), and `PumpkinCarvings.carve(player, pos, side, face)` checks it and returns a `Result` (`CARVED`, or why not). `startSession(...)` alone is for tests. The server option `carving.free_draw` (`JugcraftConfig.option`) allows only `CarvingTemplates.ALL` when false.
- **Client:** `CarvedPumpkinRenderer` draws each carved side as one quad textured by `CarvingTextures` (one 64×16 dynamic texture per design and lit state, at most 256).
- **Sizes:** `CarvingFace` handles faces of any size in `CarvingFace.SIZES` (16, and 48 for a full-grown giant pumpkin); a 16×16 face is the same ints as a `PumpkinCarving` face. The payloads carry a `CarvingFace.Sized` (the size, then exactly that many ints; other sizes are refused before reading). For a giant, `PumpkinCarvings.open` targets its master block and the session records size 48; `GiantPumpkinRenderer` draws its sides from one 192×48 texture per design. `CarvingFace.scale` blows a 16×16 face up for giants (starter faces, stencils).
- **Varieties:** `JugcraftAgriculture.carvedFrom(block)` maps each carvable pumpkin to its hand-carved block, and `carveLoot(block)` to the seeds of its first cut; the first cut also rolls `PumpkinCarvings.SCOOP`.

### Cooking Pot (`agriculture/CookingPot*`)

- **Recipes:** type `jugcraft:pot_cooking` (`CookingPotRecipe`), files in `data/jugcraft/recipe/pot_cooking/`, generated from `POT_RECIPES` in `tools/agriculture.py`. The format is the multi-input machine format: `ingredients` (each an `ingredient` and a `count`), `result` and `time`. Ingredients may sit in any of the six slots and spread over several; every filled slot must hold an ingredient. `CookingPotRecipe.find(server, slots)` returns the recipe and how much to take from each slot; the recipe list is cached and rebuilt after `/reload`.
- **Heat:** `CookingPotBlockEntity.isHeated(level, pos)` checks the block below against the block tag `jugcraft:heat_sources` (lit if it has a `lit` property). Add a heater to that tag to make it heat pots.
- **Slots:** 0–5 ingredients, 6–9 results. Hoppers insert from the top and sides and extract from the bottom.

### Feature switches (`config/`)

- `config/jugcraft.properties` holds `<feature>.enabled`. The features are the `JugcraftConfig.FEATURES` list: 16 materials plus `machines`, `deposits` (surface deposit worldgen), `explosives`, `agriculture`, `parties`, `drones`, `pixel_hollows` and `retro_trader`.
- It also holds other server options, `JugcraftConfig.OPTIONS` (read with `JugcraftConfig.option(key)`): `carving.free_draw` (default `true`).
- Text options, `JugcraftConfig.TEXT_OPTIONS` (read with `JugcraftConfig.textOption(key)`): the `seasons.*`, `harvest_feast*` and `december` settings (season/SeasonCalendar), the `parties.*` limits (party/JugcraftParties), and the Halloween event's `halloween.start` and `halloween.end` (`MM-DD`, defaults `10-20` and `11-03`), `halloween.timezone` (default `UTC`) and `halloween.mode` (`auto`, `on` or `off`). `HalloweenSeason` reads the Halloween ones; a bad value is logged and its default kept.
- A switch disables **acquisition only** (worldgen, recipes, byproducts). It never unregisters items or blocks, so saves survive.
- Check a switch with `JugcraftConfig.isFeatureEnabled(name)`.

### Seasons (`season/`, `client/SeasonColors`, `tools/seasons.py`)

- **The clock.** `JugcraftSeasons` is the one season clock.
  - `today()` gives the season day:
    - 1–365 on the northern calendar, where 29 February shares the 28th's day and the south is `SOUTH_OFFSET` (182) days on;
    - a fixed mode's day (`SeasonCalendar.Mode`: spring 105, summer 196, autumn 293, winter 15);
    - 0 when off.
  - `isActive(SeasonCalendar.Event)` tells whether an event is running: `HARVEST_FEAST` or `DECEMBER`. Events are calendar windows in the same zone.
- **Settings.** `SeasonCalendar.Settings` reads `seasons.mode`, `seasons.hemisphere`, `seasons.timezone`, `seasons.snow`, `seasons.snow_depth`, `harvest_feast`, `harvest_feast.days` and `december` (`JugcraftConfig.TEXT_OPTIONS`; read them with `JugcraftConfig.textOption`).
- **Overrides until the server stops.** `setMode`, `setFixedDate` (a preview date) and `setSnow` change the settings in memory only. The command `/jugcraft season [set|date|snow]` (`SeasonCommand`, permission level 2 to change) calls them.
- **Sync.** The server sends `SeasonPayload` (day and snowing) on join and whenever anything changes; it checks once a minute. Events are announced in chat.
- **Colours.**
  - `season/SeasonPalette.colour(day, vanilla, foliage, x, z)` holds the colour maths: keyframes `YEAR` and patchy autumn hues.
  - The client applies it to grass and foliage tints in `#jugcraft:has_seasons`, through the client mixin `mixin/client/ClientLevelSeasonMixin` on `ClientLevel.calculateBlockTint`.
- **Biome flags.** `mixin/BiomeSeasonMixin` gives every biome `SeasonalBiome` flags, `jugcraft$hasSeasons()` and `jugcraft$hasWinterSnow()`. They are set from the two biome tags whenever tags load, so hot paths need no tag lookups.
- **Winter snow.**
  - `SeasonState.snowing()` is true when `seasons.snow` is on and the season day is in 1 December to 28 February.
  - While it is true, `BiomeSeasonMixin` makes rain fall as snow in `#jugcraft:has_winter_snow`.
  - `SeasonalSnow` lays `jugcraft:seasonal_snow` (`SeasonalSnowBlock`, vanilla snow models, in `#minecraft:snow`) round players while it rains. Once it is no longer snowing, the block melts on random ticks.
- **For later seasonal content.** Read `JugcraftSeasons.today()`, `isActive(event)` or `SeasonState.snowing()` on the server. Never trust a client's date.

### Parties (`party/`)

- **Shared team rule.** Call the static methods on `JugcraftParties`: `sameParty`, `isLeader`, `partyMembers`, `partyId`, `addListener`.
- **`mayServe(systemOwner, systemMode, jobOwner, jobMode)`** with `UseMode.PERSONAL`/`PARTY` is the one rule for whether an automated system may work on another player's job. Use it; don't write your own.
- **Logic and storage:**
  - `PartyManager` holds the rules and has no Minecraft types.
  - `PartyStore` saves `<world>/jugcraft/parties.txt`.
  - `PartyCommands` provides `/party`.
- Details: [features/parties.md](features/parties.md).

### Drones (`drone/`)

- **`BuildJobs`** is the build-job interface. A `Source` offers open positions; depots reserve them, fly the materials there and call `fill`. Blueprints (#23) will be a source. `SimpleBuildJobs` is a minimal one, used by tests and the operator-only `/dronetest` command.
- **Pure logic (no Minecraft types), testable on its own:**
  - `PlatformLayout` scans the platform the Drone Tower places: separated 5x5 pads and 3x3 supply pickups. A terminal without a tower flies no drones (`allowTiersWithoutTower` is for tests and `/dronetest` only).
  - `DroneFleet` holds the roster and the cached pooled power; `DockLayout` places docked drones round the pads.
  - `FlightScheduler` runs the timed flights; `FlightPath` is each flight's shape and timing (shared by server and client).
- **World side:**
  - `DroneTerminalBlockEntity` does power, dispatch and delivery, forms pads and pickups, and sends clients a `DepotView`.
  - `DroneRoutes` picks each leg's cruise height over the terrain.
  - `DroneDepots` is the registry of loaded terminals.
  - `LandingPadBlock`, `SupplyPickupBlock`, `ControlScreenBlock` and `HoloTableBlock` are the combining plates, panels and table sections; `DepotDisplayBlockEntity` links a formed screen or table to the nearest terminal.
- **Client side:** `DroneDepotRenderer` and `DroneModel` draw the drones (all nine tiers) and the pickup lift; `ControlScreenRenderer` draws the wall display; `HoloMapRenderer` draws the hologram map; `DroneTerminalScreen` is the terminal screen.
- Tier numbers live in `DroneTier` and `tools/drones.py`; the checker keeps them in sync.
- Details: [features/drone-depot.md](features/drone-depot.md).
- **Drone Tower (`tower/`):** `JugcraftTower` registers the building blocks, furniture (`FurnitureBlock`), the Tower Core (`TowerCoreBlock`, `TowerCoreBlockEntity`) and modules. `TowerData` loads `data/jugcraft/drone_tower/tower.json.gz` (made by `tools/drone_tower.py`). `TowerBuildJobs` is the `BuildJobs.Source` for tiers 2–9. `TowerUpgradePayload` is the screen's upgrade request, and `TowerScreen` is the client screen. The terminal links to the core, and the tower gives it hangars, pickups, capacity and the drone tier cap. Details: [features/drone-tower.md](features/drone-tower.md).

### Alpine Spawn (`world/AlpineSpawn`, `tools/alpine.py`)

- **Placement.** Through `mixin/OverworldBiomeBuilderMixin`:
  - `AlpineSpawn.wrap` turns every meadow the Overworld biome builder outputs into `jugcraft:alpine_spawn` (`@ModifyVariable` on `addBiomes`);
  - `AlpineSpawn.takesPlateau` gives it the plateau table's cool row (temperature index 1) at humidity indexes 2 to 3, vanilla's forest and taiga there (`@Inject` at the head of `pickPlateauBiome`). Lowland forest and taiga are untouched.
- **The start.** On a new world's first start (game time 0, multi-noise Overworld only), `findStart` looks for the alpine village (`#jugcraft:alpine_villages`) nearest the origin, up to `VILLAGE_CELLS` (25) grid cells away, and starts on the nearest Alpine Spawn ground within `VILLAGE_REACH` (96) of it, with `VILLAGE_MARGIN` (16) around it if possible. If there is no village, it finds the nearest Alpine Spawn within `SEARCH_RADIUS` (6,400) and moves inward by `MARGIN` (48). The spawn is then set with `/setworldspawn`.
- **Villages.** `jugcraft:village_alpine` (taiga pieces, `#jugcraft:has_structure/village_alpine`) on the structure set `jugcraft:alpine_villages` (spacing 16, separation 5). It is in `#minecraft:village` and `#jugcraft:alpine_villages`.
- **Trees.** `worldgen/feature/alpine_spawn_trees` picks a larch (`jugcraft:larch_checked`) 60% of the time, otherwise a spruce; 0 to 2 tries per chunk.
- **Larch** (`agriculture/SeasonalLeavesBlock`, `TREES` in `tools/agriculture.py`):
  - `larch_needles` has a `season` state (`green`, `gold`, `bare`). It follows `JugcraftSeasons.today()` on random ticks and when placed: green from day 91, gold from 268, bare from 318. Each block is shifted by up to `JITTER` (7) days by its position. With seasons off, needles stay green.
  - A needle that changes on a random tick brings up to `SPREAD` (128) touching needles in loaded chunks up to date, so trees turn together.
  - `larch_sapling` grows `worldgen/feature/larch` (spruce foliage shape on a 7 to 10 block trunk).
  - The wood set comes from `JugcraftAgriculture.registerWoodSet`, shared with the chestnut; `WOOD_SETS` in `tools/agriculture.py` generates both. Its hand recipes follow `alpine_spawn.enabled`. There are sawmill (`sawing/larch_logs`) and tree farm (`tree_growing/larch_sapling`) recipes.
- **Settings.** `alpine_spawn.enabled` and `alpine_spawn.start`.

### Biomes branch (`biome/JugcraftRegions`, `tools/biomes.py`; roster in [branches/BIOMES.md](branches/BIOMES.md))

- **Jugcraft regions.** Irregular cells about `biomes.region_size` (1024) blocks across; `biomes.region_share` (0.5) of them are Jugcraft regions, each in one of `JugcraftRegions.LAYOUTS` (4) layouts: vanilla's climate table with that layout's rules applied. Rules are data (`RULES` in `tools/biomes.py`, generated to `/jugcraft/region_rules.json`): layouts, vanilla biome, temperature and humidity bands, weirdness half, Jugcraft biome. The recorder cuts vanilla's entries at the band edges first (`JugcraftRegions.split`). `mixin/OverworldBiomeBuilderMixin` records the layouts (`JugcraftRegions.Recorder`) and lists each Jugcraft biome in vanilla's table at `UNREACHABLE`; `mixin/MultiNoiseBiomeSourceMixin` answers lookups from the region's layout. The region of a place comes from the world seed (`ServerLevelEvents.LOAD`). `biomes.enabled=false` turns regions off.
- **Batch 1, seasonal forests** ([features/seasonal-forests.md](features/seasonal-forests.md)): `coniferous_forest` (cool taiga), `snowy_coniferous_forest` (snowy taiga), `maple_woods` (cool forest), `seasonal_forest` (temperate forest), `aspen_glade` (birch forests), `dead_forest` and `tundra` (cool plains, dry and moist), `snowy_forest` and `muskeg` (snowy plains, moister and drier). Biome files come from `tools/biomes_data.py`, built on vanilla bases (`tools/biome_bases.py`).
- **Batch 2, fields and meadows** ([features/fields-and-meadows.md](features/fields-and-meadows.md), meadow layout): `field`, `flower_meadow`, `grassland`, `heathland`, `lavender_field`, `lush_grassland`, `prairie`, `shrubland`, `steppe`.
- **Batch 3, wetlands** ([features/wetlands.md](features/wetlands.md), wetland layout; swamps and bayous also in the woodland and wild layouts): `bog`, `dead_swamp`, `lush_swamp`, `swamp_woods`, `bayou`, `floodplain`, `ghost_forest`, `sludge_mire`, `lush_river`, `fen`, `lake_district`, `quagmire`, `marsh`, `wetland`. Extras include `ponds` (vanilla lake feature, water with mud banks), `mud` (vanilla disk feature), `cranberries` (the agriculture branch's bush, ripe, in shallow water).
- **Batch 4, warm and dry** ([features/warm-and-dry.md](features/warm-and-dry.md)): meadow layout `dryland`, `xeric_shrubland`, `jacaranda_glade`, `lush_desert`, `bone_flats`, `dry_river`, `cold_desert`; wild layout `scrubland`, `lush_savanna`, `outback`, `oasis`, `wasteland`, `burnt_forest`; woodland layout `mediterranean_forest`, `orchard`.
- **Batch 5, big trees and rainforests** ([features/big-trees-and-rainforests.md](features/big-trees-and-rainforests.md)): woodland layout `rainforest`, `eucalyptus_forest`, `tropics`, `subtropics`, `dense_forest`, `woodland`; woodland and wild layouts `redwood_forest`, `temperate_rainforest`.
- **Batch 6, mountains, coasts and volcanoes** ([features/mountains-coasts-and-volcanoes.md](features/mountains-coasts-and-volcanoes.md)): wild layout `volcano`, `canyon`, `highland`, `basin`, `shield`, `karst_pinnacles`, `hot_springs`; wetland layout `gravel_beach`, `dune_beach`, `overgrown_beach`, `flower_isle`; both `ice_sheet`, `ocean_trench`. A surface's floor or under may be a material rule written out (the Canyon's `minecraft:bandlands`).
- **Batch 7, wonders and caves** ([features/wonders-and-caves.md](features/wonders-and-caves.md)): woodland layout `frostlight_garden`, `toadstool_field`; meadow layout `cinder_barrens`, `elder_vale`, `hallowed_bog`, `starlit_wood`, `webwood`; wetland layout `gilded_shrubland`, `highsun_meadow`, `wild_greens` and the cave `glowcap_grotto`; wild layout `glimmer_grove`, `gloomweald`, `mycelial_jungle`, `shrine_springs`, `snowpetal_grove` and the cave `spider_nest`. Biomes may replace their base's monster list (`"monsters"`). Huge mushrooms are tree picks (`huge_red_mushroom_on_soil`, `huge_brown_mushroom_on_soil`).
- **Batch 8, the Nether** ([features/nether-biomes.md](features/nether-biomes.md)): `ashfall_wastes`, `blighted_sands`, `frost_rift`, `fungal_thicket`, `magma_fields`, `marrow_heap`, `netherbrush`, `quartz_rift`, `withered_hollow`. Placed by Fabric's `NetherBiomes` from the generated `/jugcraft/dimension_biomes.json` (`biome/JugcraftDimensions`; a biome's `"dimension"` and `"nether": [temperature, humidity, offset]` in `tools/biomes.py`). Their `"ground"` is a generated `jugcraft:ground_<biome>` vegetation patch on every floor layer (step 2).
- **Batch 9, the End** ([features/end-biomes.md](features/end-biomes.md)): highlands `chorus_reef`, `ender_wilds`, `phantom_garden`, `rotted_expanse` (an eighth of the highlands each) and barrens `outer_flats` (a third of the barrens beside vanilla's End Highlands), placed by Fabric's `TheEndBiomes`. `tools/biomes.py` gives `"end": {"zone", "share"}`; the generator turns shares into Fabric weights with `tools/end_noise.py`, because Fabric's noise-based pick does not give shares in proportion to weights. Their ground replaces `#jugcraft:end_ground_replaceable` (end stone).
- **Surfaces.** A biome's `"surface"` (floor, under, noise patches) is generated into the material rule `jugcraft:overworld/surface`, run first by an override of `minecraft:overworld`'s top-level material rule (`OVERWORLD_MATERIAL_RULE` in `tools/biomes_data.py`). Tree wrappers `PLACED_TREES` (`chestnut_checked`, `azalea_tree_checked`).
- **Wild plants** (`tools/plants.py`, `tools/plants_data.py`, textures `tools/wild_textures.py`): registered alike from the generated `/jugcraft/plants.json` by `JugcraftAgriculture.registerWildPlants`: flowers (`FlowerBlock`, with `potted_` forms), tall flowers (`TallFlowerBlock`) and flowerbeds (`GroundCoverBlock`, like pink petals). Batch 2: `lavender`, `tall_lavender`, `goldenrod`, `heather`, `orange_cosmos`, `clover`. Batch 3: `cattail` (tall plant, `DoublePlantBlock`), `watergrass` (`WaterPlantBlock`, seagrass-like), `duckweed` (`FloatingPlantBlock`, like a lily pad). Batch 5: `hibiscus` (flower), `hydrangea` (tall flower). Batch 6: `sea_oats` (`DunePlantBlock`, a tall plant that stands on `#minecraft:supports_dry_vegetation`, sand included). Batch 7: `glowcap` (`FloorPlantBlock`: light 10, any sturdy floor), `glimmerbloom` (flower, light 7), `frost_iris` (flower), `snowpetals` (flowerbed). Batch 8: `bramble` (`FloorPlantBlock`). A plant's `"light"` makes it glow. Each has a placement feature `jugcraft:<plant>` that biomes scatter through `EXTRAS`.
- **Trees** (`tools/trees.py`, `tools/trees_data.py`): `JugcraftAgriculture.registerTree` registers each tree's sapling, leaves and wood set: larch, maple and aspen leaves are `SeasonalLeavesBlock`s with their own `Schedule` (`LARCH_LEAVES`, `MAPLE_LEAVES`, `ASPEN_LEAVES`); fir needles are evergreen. `dead` is a wood set with no tree block of its own. Shapes: `larch`, `maple`, `big_maple`, `maple_bush`, `aspen`, `fir`, `tall_fir`, `jacaranda` (evergreen blossom leaves), `willow` (seasonal `WILLOW_LEAVES`, cherry foliage shape with hanging leaves, vine decorator), `palm` (bending trunk, acacia fronds; placed where a dead bush could stand), `cypress`, `desert_acacia` (vanilla acacia), `oak_bush` and `tall_vine_oak` (vanilla oak), `redwood` and `giant_redwood` (giant trunk, mega pine crown, podzol), `eucalyptus` (random-spread crown) and `big_eucalyptus`, `mahogany` (forking, vines) and `giant_mahogany` (mega jungle trunk), `small_palm`, `spruce_bush` (vanilla spruce), `great_oak` (vanilla oak, giant trunk), `dead_tree`, and fallen logs. Redwood and mahogany saplings are `agriculture/GiantSaplingBlock`s: four in a square grow the giant (`GIANT_GROWERS`; agriculture.TREES `"giant"`). Maple's autumn look is a weighted pick of red, orange and gold models. Every tree feature with seasonal leaves lists the `jugcraft:seasonal_leaves` tree decorator (`agriculture/SeasonalLeavesDecorator`), which gives generated leaves today's look.

### Registration (`materials/`)

- `JugcraftRegistry.item(path)` and `block(path, copyFrom)` register simple items and blocks.
- `MetalFamily.builder(name).mined().extraItem(...).build()` registers a whole metal set. `MineralFamily.register(name)` does the same for minerals.
- `JugcraftWorldgen` adds placed features to biomes. In 26.x, configured features live in `data/jugcraft/worldgen/feature/` (there is no `configured_feature` folder), with no `config` wrapper and with block states written as plain IDs.
- Surface deposits (`deposit/`): `JugcraftDeposits` registers the `DepositBlock`s (mirrors `tools/deposits.py`); `Deposits` keeps how much each touched deposit block has given (`SavedData`, `jugcraft_deposits.dat`) and turns an empty one to stone. `JugcraftWorldgen.addDeposit` adds their disk features to the stony hill biomes at `LOCAL_MODIFICATIONS`.
- Initialization order is in `Jugcraft.onInitialize()`: config → materials → components → deposits → machines → fluids → petroleum → logistics → storage → electronics → farming → prospecting → kinetics → tools → guide → agriculture → drones, the tower and blueprints → Pixel Hollows → Retro Trader → seasons → conditions → worldgen → parties → style pack.

### Looks (`tools/model_writer.py`, `tools/steampunk_*.py`)

- There are two machine styles. **Steampunk** is the default (`DEFAULT_STYLE`). **Classic** ships as the built-in pack `jugcraft:alternate_machines`.
- Steampunk models are built from Python helpers: `box`, `cyl`, `gear`, `wheel`, `dial`, `pipe`.
- **Rules:** no coplanar overlapping faces; near the middle of each side, the body comes within about 1 px of the edge, so cables meet it; glowing textures are listed in `GLOW` (and have `_on` variants).
- Every new machine needs a model in `steampunk_models.MODELS` **and** classic front textures (`<id>_front`, plus `_front_on` if lit). The checker verifies that both styles cover every block state.

## How to add things

**A new processing machine** (single input):

1. `tools/machines.py`: add the entry to `MACHINES`, `STATS`, `CRAFTING`, and a recipe list in `machine_recipes()`.
2. `generate_material_data.py`: add it to `RECIPE_TYPES`.
3. `MachineKind`: add the enum constant, and include it in `isProcessor()`, `recipeType()` and, if needed, `byproductSlots()` or `tankCapacity()`.
4. Draw the textures (`generate_textures.py` for classic, `steampunk_textures.py`) and the model (`steampunk_models.py`).
5. Run the generators and the checker.
6. Add a game test.

**A new recipe for an existing machine:** add it to the list in `tools/machines.py` (Jugcraft's own recipes), or ship a JSON file in any data pack.

**A new metal:** add it to `METALS` in `tools/materials.py` (with `gen` for worldgen) and add the matching `MetalFamily.builder(...)` in `JugcraftMaterials`. The checker compares the two.

**A block that uses power, fluid or items:** register a provider on `EnergyStorage.SIDED`, `FluidStorage.SIDED` or `ItemStorage.SIDED`. Implement the matching `*Connectable` marker if transmitters should visibly connect.

**A new crop:** add it to `tools/agriculture.py` (`TALL_CROPS` or `CROPS`, its items in `ITEMS`, and optionally a wild plant). A climbing crop sets `"trellis": True` and its seed `"trellis_seed": True`. Then:

1. Mirror it in Java: a `TallCrop` constant, or a `crop(...)` call plus item calls in `JugcraftAgriculture` (`trellisSeeds(...)` for a climbing crop's seed).
2. Draw its stage textures in `tools/crop_textures.py`, `tools/kitchen_textures.py` or `tools/festival_textures.py`.
3. Run both generators and the checker, which compares the Python and the Java.
4. Add a game test to `AgricultureGameTests`, `KitchenGardenGameTests`, `FestivalGameTests` or `CarvingGameTests`.

**A Cooking Pot dish:** add it to `POT_RECIPES` (and its item to `ITEMS`) in `tools/agriculture.py`, or drop a `jugcraft:pot_cooking` recipe into a data pack. The checker refuses two recipes with the same ingredients.

**A handbook page:** add prose to `ABOUT` in `tools/handbook.py` and list the block in a chapter in `build()`. Its numbers, crafting grid and recipes are filled in from the tables.

**A client game test** (real rendering, screenshots): extend `JugcraftClientGameTests.runTest` (Fabric client game test API). CI job `client` runs it.

**A game test:** add a public `@GameTest` method to `src/gametest/java/.../JugcraftGameTests.java` (or `AgricultureGameTests.java` for crops; `AgricultureClientGameTests` takes crop screenshots).

- Helpers:
  - `machine(kind)`: the block state to place.
  - `charge(helper, pos, side)`: fills the machine's energy.
  - `processing(helper, pos, kind, input)`: places, charges and loads a machine.
  - `chest(helper, pos)`, `extractor(helper, pos, intake)` and `count(chest, item)`.
- End with `helper.succeed()`, `helper.succeedWhen(...)` or `helper.runAtTickTime(tick, ...)`.

## Rules the checks enforce (`tools/check_mod_data.py`)

- **No free metal.** Every recipe keeps or loses metal (in nugget units). The only exceptions:
  - ore blocks ×2 (crusher, pulverizer) or ×3 (ore washer);
  - byproducts, which average at most 25% of the input's metal;
  - renewable sieve finds, which average under one nugget per operation.
- Bronze is never turned back into its ingredients.
- Every recipe has a feature-switch condition that includes its result's feature.
- Python lists must match Java: `MachineKind` numbers and recipe types, `JugcraftComponents` lists, materials, features, worldgen, and every agriculture number (`TallCrop`, items, foods, compost tiers, sickles, wild-plant and wild-patch biomes, grass seeds, legume bonus, gourds, cranberry and chestnut numbers, the lantern's light, and the carving numbers, starter faces and messages).
- Every tall-crop age and section, and every crop age, has a model. Agriculture recipes (crafting, cooking and Cooking Pot) never form a loop, no two Cooking Pot recipes share their ingredients, a seed is a trellis seed exactly when it plants a climbing crop, and a bog seed exactly when it plants the cranberry bush. Every stem age, cranberry age and leaf fruit state has a model.
- Every ID has a model, a texture, a name, and a loot table (for blocks). Both machine styles cover every block state. Model elements stay within −16..32. Loot tables are written in 26.3's form (`condition`, `modifier`, `type`); the checker rejects the pre-26 `conditions`/`functions`/`function` keys, which 26.3 ignores without an error.
- No recipe makes pixel shards. The Retro Trader's Java trades and map-search bounds match `tools/pixel_hollows.py`, and his shard buyback never pays more per shard than his cheapest possible shard sale.

## Not built yet

- Chemistry branch: PVC, bleach and enrichment (the oil line, electrochemistry, advanced materials and gas storage exist). Blast-furnace stand-ins remain as the simple routes.
- Electronics beyond processors: a monitor-bank multi-block, computers that control machines, and uses for processors in the tiers above.
- EMI and REI plugins (JEI has one).
- A faster fluid pipe (pointless until pumps are faster).
- Any magic, creature, travel or seasonal content from [CONTENT_BRANCHES.md](CONTENT_BRANCHES.md), apart from the seasons (colours, the Harvest Feast and December windows, and winter snow) and the agriculture branch's Halloween. Farming has a harvester, sprinkler and cotton (`farming/`), and the agriculture branch its slices so far; greenhouses, rubber trees and the rest of the crop roster are not built (planned in [branches/AGRICULTURE.md](branches/AGRICULTURE.md)). (The Pixel Hollows is the first cave biome; it has no creatures, structures or bosses yet.)
- Human play-testing, two-client dedicated-server tests and performance measurements (the client game tests render the game but do not play it).
- Handbook translations (English only).

### Stored fluid on items
- `fluid/StoredFluid` (record: `FluidVariant`, droplets) is the `jugcraft:stored_fluid` data component (`JugcraftFluids.STORED_FLUID`, persistent and synced).
- `FluidTankBlockEntity` and `MachineBlockEntity` (steel tank, gas holder reservoirs) write it in `collectImplicitComponents` and read it in `applyImplicitComponents`; loot tables copy it with `copy_components` (multi-block tanks only from part 0, and `LargeMachineBlock` breaks the master when another part goes).
- `client/JugcraftClient` adds its tooltip line through `ItemTooltipCallback`.
