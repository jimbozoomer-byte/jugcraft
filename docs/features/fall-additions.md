# Fall Additions

Status: the chandlery (addition 1), the cider mill (addition 2), the preserves pantry (addition 3), crows and working scarecrows (addition 4), spooky fireworks (addition 5) and the sky lantern festival (addition 6) are implemented in source, not yet played. The Build workflow compiles it, and CI's game tests pass (recorded below).
Proposal issue: none; requested directly by the owner on 2 October 2026 ("ok lets build another 10 more thorough and well thought out festive halloween and fall additions, maybe for one we do candle making with an interesting process to make them allowing you to make a bunch of different combinations and then light them to give different cool effects to an aoe area like beacons do"). The ten additions ship one per pull request, each stacked on the one before:
1. the chandlery: the Wax Melting Pot and Aura Candles;
2. the cider mill: apple trees, the Cider Press, the Cider Barrel and four ciders;
3. the preserves pantry: Mason Jars, eight preserves, the Canning Kettle and the Pantry Shelf;
4. crows and working scarecrows: crows that raid ripe crops, and scarecrows that keep them off;
5. spooky fireworks: rockets that burst into a bat, a jack o'lantern, a ghost or a skull drawn in sparks, and the Show Launcher;
6. the sky lantern festival: Sky Lanterns that drift up together, the festival eight of them make, and mooncakes for a full moon;
7. a harvest feast table (planned);
8. a corn maze (planned);
9. ghost hunting (planned; its ectoplasm is to become a candle scent);
10. face paint (planned).

Owner: @jimbozoomer-byte
Target milestone and tier: the chandlery is Discovery tier: copper ingots (the pot), honeycomb or rotten flesh (wax), string (wicks), dyes, and vanilla items an early player can gather (sugar, a rabbit's foot, a golden carrot, a feather, a pufferfish, magma cream, an amethyst shard, a ghast tear, a fermented spider eye, bone meal, a glow ink sac, glowstone dust and redstone). The ghast tear and magma cream are Nether items; every other scent is from the Overworld. The cider mill is Discovery tier too: planks, an iron ingot, a grindstone and wooden slabs (the press); a barrel, iron and gold nuggets and sticks (the barrel); apples (from oak leaves, and then apple trees), glass bottles, and for the extras sugar, sweet berries, cocoa beans, wheat and an egg. So is the pantry: glass and an iron nugget (jars), a cauldron, blue dye and iron bars (the kettle), planks and slabs (the shelf), and what the preserves are made of (sweet berries, apples, a pumpkin, cranberries, glow berries, beetroot, peppers, corn, onions, sugar, and the cider mill's sweet cider, mulling spices, aged cider and pomace). Spooky fireworks are Discovery tier too: paper, gunpowder and the picture's ingredients (a feather and black dye, a carved pumpkin, a phantom membrane or a bone), and glowstone dust to twinkle; the Show Launcher is a dispenser, iron ingots, planks and redstone. Crows need nothing to come but a ripe crop; the scarecrow that keeps them off is the existing one (a hay bale, wool and sticks), and its pumpkin heads come from any pumpkin patch. The sky lantern festival is Discovery tier too: paper, string and a candle (lanterns), any dye for a colour and an anvil for a wish; mooncakes are baked in the Kitchen Garden's Cooking Pot from wheat, sugar, an egg and beans, roasted chestnuts or a pumpkin.
Primary specialty and supported player role: crafting and support. Chandlers make candles for builders (light in any colour), farmers (the harvest aura), explorers and miners (night vision, water breathing, fire resistance, haste), and groups (one candle covers everyone near it). Candles are easy to trade: each one carries its own wax, colour, scents and burn time. The cider mill is for farmers and cooks: orchard keepers grow apples, and a cider maker presses them and ages the cider. Its drinks are for anyone (haste for miners, jump boost, absorption before a fight, regeneration after), and a barrel of aged cider is the centrepiece of a harvest party. The pantry is for cooks who put up the harvest: preserves keep (once sealed) and travel, so a stocked pantry feeds a long expedition or a harvest feast. Crows are for farmers: a little pressure on open fields, answered by building and dressing scarecrows, and a source of feathers for fletchers and chandlers. Spooky fireworks are for anyone throwing a party: one rocket for a moment, or a Show Launcher's nine tubes for a planned show. Sky lanterns are for gatherings: one player can let eight go and hold a festival alone, but a crowd fills the sky faster, and everyone there shares the Luck; mooncakes are for cooks, and for anyone out under a full moon.

Nothing here depends on the Halloween event: candles are made and burned, and cider pressed and aged, and preserves put up, all year; crows come to fields all year too, and fireworks and sky lanterns go up whenever someone lets them go. A mooncake's Luck comes with every full moon, one night in eight.

## Player experience
### The Wax Melting Pot
1. A hammered copper pot with a rolled rim, a pouring lip and two handles (seven copper ingots, shaped like a cauldron). Set it over a heat source: a lit campfire, fire, soul fire, lava or a magma block (the same `jugcraft:heat_sources` the Cooking Pot uses).
2. **Put wax in:** honeycomb is beeswax (two measures a comb); rotten flesh renders down to tallow (one measure). A pot holds one wax at a time, up to eight measures. Over the heat a measure melts every five seconds, and the wax rises in the pot. Away from heat, molten wax sets again, a measure every fifteen seconds.
3. **Mix the molten wax:**
   - **Dyes** colour it. Several dyes mix as they do on leather (red and blue make purple), so any colour a leather tunic can take, a candle can.
   - **Scents** give the candle its aura. Two at most go in a pot; a third is refused, and so is one already in it. The eleven scents and what stirs them in are listed below.
   - **Glowstone dust** brightens it: a stronger aura (level II), but the candle burns twice as fast.
   - **Redstone** makes it burn half as long again.
   - Each of these lasts until the pot is empty, so one scent item flavours up to eight layers.
   Coloured scent wisps drift up from the pot, and the wax bubbles. Use it with an empty hand to see what is in it ("Beeswax: 6 of 8 measures molten, Swiftness, Moonlight, brightened"); sneak with an empty hand to pour it all away.
4. **Dip a candle.** Use string on the molten wax and it comes out as a one-layer candle of that wax, colour and mixture. That uses a measure.
5. **Dip it again to build it up,** but only once its last layer has cooled: two seconds, shown as a cooldown on the hotbar. Dipped while still warm, the new layer slides off and its wax is lost. Each layer:
   - makes the candle taller and its aura wider (5, 8, 12, then 16 blocks);
   - makes its light stronger (8, 10, 12, then 14);
   - adds its own burn time;
   - turns its outside the new wax's colour;
   - adds the new wax's scents to the ones the candle already carries.
   Four layers is as big as a candle gets.
6. **Combinations:** a candle carries every scent of every layer it was dipped in. Two scents work together; a third muddles it ("Muddled Beeswax Candle"): it lights, but gives no aura. So the art is in dipping different pots in the right order: a layer of swiftness wax under a layer of moonlight wax makes a candle of both. With 11 scents, 2 waxes, 16 dyes (and their mixes), brightening, extending and four sizes, there are thousands of candles to make.
7. A candle is named for what it carries ("Beeswax Candle of Swiftness and Moonlight", in the scents' colours). Its tooltip shows the aura's reach, how long it burns, its layers and whether it is brightened or long-burning.

### The scents
| Scent | Stirred in with | Aura |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Swiftness | sugar | players get Speed |
| Leaping | a rabbit's foot | players get Jump Boost |
| Moonlight | a golden carrot | players get Night Vision |
| Featherfall | a feather | players get Slow Falling |
| Tide | a pufferfish | players get Water Breathing |
| Ember | magma cream | players get Fire Resistance |
| Diligence | an amethyst shard | players get Haste |
| Mending | a ghast tear | players get Regeneration |
| Warding | a fermented spider eye | hostile mobs are slowed and weakened |
| Harvest | bone meal | growing plants get extra growth ticks |
| Revealing | a glow ink sac | other creatures glow, so they show through walls |

Each scent is an item tag (`jugcraft:candle_scents/<scent>`), so packs can add items to it.

### Aura Candles
8. Place a candle on any block with a solid top: it stands on a brass dish with a finger ring. Light it with flint and steel or a fire charge; use it with an empty hand to snuff it, keeping what is left.
9. **Lit, it works like a small beacon:**
   - Every four seconds its aura pulses over a box reaching its radius in every direction. Players inside get each scent's effect for nine seconds, so it never runs out while they stay.
   - A ring of the scents' colours shows the edge of the aura at each pulse, and their wisps rise from the flame.
   - The flame is tinted by the first scent (a warm yellow for an unscented or muddled candle), and a tallow candle smokes a little.
10. **It burns down as it burns:** it shrinks to a quarter of its height, then goes out for good in a puff of smoke. A layer of beeswax burns four minutes; a layer of tallow two. Brightening halves that; redstone makes it half as long again. A long-burning beeswax candle of four layers burns 24 minutes.
11. Broken, a candle drops itself as it is, part-burned, with its name, colour and scents, to be placed and lit again later. Burned out, it is gone.

### The apple tree
12. **Apple trees** grow wild in plains and flower-rich places (meadows, flower forests, sunflower plains): a short oak trunk under a rounded crown of apple leaves.
13. Their leaves (the ones the tree grew, with air below them) **blossom** white and pink and then **hang with ripe red apples**, about a Minecraft day from bare leaves to ripe. Use ripe leaves with an empty hand to pick them: 1 to 3 apples fall, and the leaves start again. Leaves a player placed never fruit.
14. **Apple seeds** plant an apple sapling on dirt or grass, which grows like any sapling (bone meal works). Broken apple leaves drop seeds now and then (as oak leaves drop saplings), sticks, and now and then an apple. The pomace from the press gives seeds too, so vanilla apples alone are enough to start an orchard.

### The Cider Press
15. A slatted oak basket bound with iron, on a trough, under a beam with an iron screw. Behind it is the grinder (the scratter): a drum under a hopper, with a crank. It faces you when placed.
16. **Grind:** put apples in the hopper, one at a time, up to eight. Use the press with an empty hand to **turn the crank**: an apple is ground into pulp in the basket, with a crunch and a splash. The crank turns once every 8 ticks, however fast anyone clicks.
17. **Press:** once the hopper is empty, an empty hand **turns the screw** instead.
    - The plate comes down on the pulp (the "cheese"), and each of four turns squeezes out a quarter of its juice into the trough, a serving for every apple.
    - The capstan bar on the beam turns a quarter turn each time, and the pulp squashes lower.
    - Nothing more goes in until the cheese is pressed out.
    - The last turn frees the screw and **knocks out the pomace** (one for every two apples).
18. **Bottle it:** a glass bottle draws a serving of juice from the trough: **Sweet Cider**. The trough holds eight servings; the screw won't turn while a turn's juice wouldn't fit. Sneak with an empty hand to see what is in the press. Comparators read the juice.

### The Cider Barrel
19. An oak cask on its side in a cradle, with iron hoops, a brass tap and a bung. Pour **Sweet Cider** in by the bottle (the bottles come back), up to sixteen servings.
20. **It ages by itself:**
    - A day after the last fresh serving went in, the batch is **Sparkling Cider** (it fizzes at the bung); three days after, **Aged Cider**.
    - A chalk mark on its head shows the stage (one stroke, two, three).
    - A batch that has begun to ferment takes no more fresh juice, so new juice can't be slipped into an old batch; topping up a sweet batch starts its day again.
21. A glass bottle draws off a serving of whatever it has become. Use it with an empty hand to see how much is in it and how long to the next stage. Comparators read how full it is.
22. Broken, a barrel keeps its cider, and the cider keeps ageing while it is carried.

### Ciders and what they make
| Drink | How it's made | Food | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sweet Cider | bottled from the press | 3 | Haste, 30 s |
| Sparkling Cider | a day in the barrel | 3 | Jump Boost, 60 s |
| Aged Cider | three days in the barrel | 4 | Absorption, 120 s |
| Mulled Cider | sparkling cider and mulling spices in the Cooking Pot | 6 | Regeneration, 15 s |

23. Every cider is drunk even on a full stomach and leaves its bottle.
24. **Mulling Spices:** sugar, sweet berries and cocoa beans make two.
25. **Apple Cider Donuts:** two wheat, sugar, an egg and a Sweet Cider make four cinnamon-sugar donuts (3 food each); the cider's bottle comes back. They count as candy, for Candy Bowls and Candy Bags.
26. **Apple Pomace** feeds pigs and goes in the composter; crafted, it gives apple seeds.

### Preserves
27. **Mason Jars** (glass round an iron nugget lid, three a craft) are cooked full of preserves in the **Cooking Pot**:

| Preserve | In the pot with a Mason Jar | A serving | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sweet Berry Jam | 6 sweet berries, 2 sugar | 3 food | |
| Apple Butter | 3 apples, sugar, a Sweet Cider (apple butter is cooked down in cider) | 4 food | |
| Pumpkin Butter | a pumpkin, 2 sugar, Mulling Spices | 4 food | |
| Cranberry Preserves | 6 cranberries, 2 sugar | 3 food | |
| Glow Berry Jelly | 6 glow berries, 2 sugar | 2 food | Night Vision, 30 s |
| Pickled Beets | 4 beetroot, Cider Vinegar | 2 food | |
| Pickled Peppers | 4 peppers, Cider Vinegar | 2 food | Fire Resistance, 15 s |
| Corn Relish | 2 corn, a pepper, an onion, Cider Vinegar | 3 food | |

28. **Cider Vinegar:** Aged Cider soured on Apple Pomace in the Cooking Pot (a bottle a batch). Pickling with it leaves its bottle in the pot.
29. **A jar holds four servings.** Eat it like food, a serving at a time; the last serving leaves the empty Mason Jar to fill again. Its tooltip says how many servings are left and whether it is sealed.
30. **Unsealed jars spoil.** Fresh from the pot a jar is unsealed: it keeps three days from when it was cooked. After that a serving is 1 food, with Hunger and Nausea ("Ugh! That jar had gone off"). An opened jar also keeps three days from when it was opened.

### The Canning Kettle
31. A big speckled-blue enamel kettle with a jar rack (a cauldron, blue dye and iron bars). Fill it with a **water bucket** and set it over a fire (anything in `jugcraft:heat_sources`).
32. Stand up to **four full, fresh jars** in the water. An opened jar, or one already sealed, is refused, and so is any jar while there's no water.
33. The water comes to a **rolling boil** after ten seconds over the fire (bubbles and steam). Each jar that has been **twenty seconds in boiling water seals**. Off the fire the water cools again and nothing seals.
34. Use the kettle with an empty hand to **lift out the sealed jars**, with a pop. Sneak to lift out every jar, sealed or not (or, with none ready, to see how it's doing). An empty bucket takes the water back while no jars are in it. Comparators read how many jars have sealed.
35. **A sealed jar keeps until it is opened**, stacks with other sealed jars of the same preserve, and wears a red gingham cap tied with string.

### The Pantry Shelf
36. An open oak cupboard with a beadboard back and two shelves. Use it holding a jar (full, opened, sealed or empty) to put it up, three to a shelf; use it with an empty hand to take the last one down. Comparators read how full it is; broken, it spills its jars.

### Crows
37. **Crows come to fields by day.** Every ten seconds, for each player in the Overworld, there is a three-in-ten chance the game looks at one spot 16 to 40 blocks away. If a ripe crop open to the sky is within six blocks of it, a flock of two or three crows arrives in the sky above. There are at most six crows near a player and 32 in the world. They come only while mobs spawn (the `spawn_mobs` game rule).
38. **A crow wheels a few blocks over the ground, cawing.** Now and then it spots a ripe crop open to the sky within 12 blocks, drops onto it and pecks at it for two seconds, its head bobbing; then the crop is **three growth stages back** (for wheat, from ripe to age 4). It rests 30 to 60 seconds before it raids again. Crows go for any fully grown crop of the vanilla crop kind: wheat, carrots, potatoes, beetroot, and Jugcraft's beans, sweet potatoes, flax, onions, garlic, cabbage, oats, barley and turnips. Tall crops, gourds and pumpkins on stems, bushes and trees are safe, and so is anything under a roof.
39. **Pecking follows the `mob_griefing` game rule.** With it off, crows still come and wheel about but leave crops alone.
40. **Scaring them off:** a crow takes flight from a player within six blocks (sneaking, you can get within two and a half), from a blow, and from a scarecrow; the crop it was after is spared. Crows don't attack.
41. **At nightfall** crows give up their crops and climb away out of sight.
42. **Crows drop up to two feathers** (for arrows, and for the chandlery's Featherfall scent). They have two hearts.

### Working scarecrows
43. **A Scarecrow now guards the crops round it:** within 4 blocks bare, 8 wearing a pumpkin head, and 12 wearing a lit one (a jack o'lantern, or a hand-carved pumpkin with a torch in it), measured across the ground from its head, and up to 6 blocks above or below it. Crows won't go for a guarded crop, and a crow after a crop takes flight within half a second of a scarecrow going up beside it.
44. Nothing else about the scarecrow changes: it is placed, dressed, dyed and broken as before. It stands on any block with a solid top, so in a field it goes on a dirt, grass or path block rather than on farmland.

### Spooky fireworks
45. **Four spooky fireworks**, each bursting into a picture drawn in coloured sparks: a **bat** (violet wings, red eyes), a **jack o'lantern** (orange, with a green stem and a glowing yellow face), a **ghost** (white, with a pale blue hem) and a **skull** (bone white). Dark details (eyes, sockets, a mouth) are left as holes in the picture, since dark sparks would vanish against the night.
46. **Every player sees the picture the right way round:** each client draws it facing its own player, so a crowd round a launcher all see the bat's wings spread, not edge on.
47. **Crafting:** paper, one to three gunpowder (the flight, as vanilla's rockets) and the picture's ingredients (a feather and black dye, a carved pumpkin, a phantom membrane, a bone) make three. Add glowstone dust and the sparks **twinkle** as they fade.
48. **Setting one off:** use it on a block and it climbs, trailing sparks, for a second or two by its flight, and bursts with a bang. Spooky fireworks hurt nothing and break nothing, and can't boost elytra flight. A dispenser facing up sets one off as by hand; facing any other way, it fires it straight out.

### The Show Launcher
49. A painted crate of **nine mortar tubes**, three rows of three, in orange and black, with a brass dial on its front. Each tube holds **up to sixteen rockets** of one kind, spooky or vanilla; the nose of the next rocket peeks out of each loaded tube.
50. Use it holding rockets to load them (matching tubes first, then empty ones). Hoppers can load it from any side and unload it from below.
51. **Starting a show:** use it with an empty hand, or give it a rising redstone signal; do it again to stop. Sneak and use it with an empty hand to turn the dial between three ways of firing:
    - **in sequence:** one rocket every half second, round the loaded tubes in turn;
    - **in volleys:** a row of three every second, front row first;
    - **as a finale:** one from every tube at once.
52. Rockets leave the tubes **fanned out from the middle**, so a volley or a finale spreads across the sky. A show runs until the tubes are empty (a finale fires once). Comparators read how many tubes are loaded; broken, it spills its rockets.

### Sky lanterns
53. **Sky Lanterns:** five paper, two string and a candle make two. Dye one in the crafting grid, as leather armour is dyed (warm red undyed), and name it in an anvil: the name is its **wish**, shown over it as it rises.
54. **Letting one go:** use it and it is lit and let go just in front of you. It rises 0.7 blocks a second, bobbing a little and turning slowly, and drifts on **a wind every lantern shares**: 0.3 blocks a second, its direction turning full circle every three days. Lanterns let go together drift together, so a festival's lanterns rise as one cloud.
55. **Glowing and burning out:** the paper glows in its colour, lighter where the flame shines through, and flickers. A lantern burns for two minutes to two and a half, dims over its last five seconds and is gone; one that rises above the world is gone too. A blow tears it and puts it out with a hiss. It lights no blocks and sets nothing alight.

### The lantern festival
56. **Eight lanterns let go within 32 blocks of each other in two minutes**, by one player or many, make a festival. Everyone within 32 blocks is told "The sky fills with lanterns! Make a wish", gets **Luck for five minutes** and earns **A Sky Full of Wishes**. The same place holds no second festival for a day.

### Mooncakes
57. **Three mooncakes**, baked four at a time in the Cooking Pot (15 seconds) from two wheat, a sugar, an egg and a filling: **red bean** (two beans), **chestnut** (two roasted chestnuts) or **pumpkin** (a pumpkin).
58. Each is 3 food. Eaten **outdoors on a full-moon night** (the sky open above you), a mooncake also gives **Luck for five minutes**.

## Connections
- Existing input producer: vanilla copper (the pot), bees (honeycomb), zombies (rotten flesh), spiders (string), dyes, and the scent items above; Jugcraft's `jugcraft:heat_sources` (the Cooking Pot's heat).
- Existing output consumer:
  - Light in any colour and size, for builders.
  - Status effects for every player in range.
  - Growth for farms: the harvest aura speeds up every plant that takes random ticks and bone meal, including Jugcraft's own crops (corn and the other tall crops, gourds, cranberries and giant pumpkins).
  - Candles go back into the pot to be built up.
- Technology connection: none needed. The pot uses the same heat rule as the Cooking Pot, so any heat source added to that tag later heats both.
- Magic connection: none yet. The planned ghost hunting addition (9) is to add a scent made from ectoplasm, through the same `jugcraft:candle_scents/*` tags.
- Reachable entry path: copper, honeycomb or rotten flesh, string and a campfire are all early-game; no candle needs another candle or anything from later tiers. Tallow candles need nothing from bees.
- Required vs optional: all optional; nothing in progression needs a candle. Nothing here is gated by the Halloween event.
- Trade and solo routes: a solo player can make every candle; candles also stack (16) and carry everything they are, so a chandler can make them for others.
- How this stays useful without other branches: every scent's effect is useful on its own, and the harvest aura helps any farm.
- Cider mill, input producer: vanilla apples (oak leaves, villagers, chests) and then apple trees; the Cooking Pot (mulled cider) with its heat sources; wheat, sugar, eggs, sweet berries and cocoa beans; glass bottles.
- Cider mill, output consumer:
  - drinks for everyone;
  - donuts for Candy Bowls and Candy Bags (the existing `c:foods/candy` tag);
  - pomace for pigs (the vanilla `minecraft:pig_food` tag) and composters;
  - seeds for orchards.
- Pantry, input producer: the Cooking Pot and its heat sources; Agriculture's crops (cranberries, peppers, corn, onions) and vanilla ones (sweet berries, glow berries, beetroot, apples, pumpkins); the cider mill's sweet cider, mulling spices, aged cider and pomace.
- Pantry, output consumer: food that keeps (sealed jars), for expeditions and for the planned harvest feast (addition 7), which is to count dishes; preserves join `c:foods`.
- Pantry, entry path: glass, an iron nugget, a cauldron, dye and iron bars are early-game; every preserve has a crop that grows wild or is vanilla. Only pickles need the cider mill (for vinegar).
- Cider mill, entry path: apples drop from vanilla oak leaves, and a pressed apple's pomace gives apple seeds, so the first orchard needs no wild apple tree. The press and barrel are crafted from vanilla materials.
- Crows, input producer: any ripe crop open to the sky; the existing Scarecrow, and pumpkins, jack o'lanterns and hand-carved pumpkins for its head.
- Crows, output consumer: feathers, for vanilla arrows and the chandlery's Featherfall scent (`jugcraft:candle_scents/featherfall`); a use for scarecrows beyond decoration.
- Crows, entry path: none needed to meet them; a scarecrow is a hay bale, wool and three sticks, all early-game.
- Crows, required vs optional: crows are a nuisance, never a gate. A pecked crop is set back, never destroyed, and grows again; nothing in storage is touched. The game rules turn spawning and pecking off.
- Fireworks, input producer: paper (sugar cane), gunpowder (creepers), feathers (chickens, and now crows), black dye, carved pumpkins, phantom membranes, bones, glowstone dust; vanilla firework rockets in the launcher.
- Fireworks, output consumer: celebrations: the Halloween events, the Carving Contest and the regatta, and the harvest feast to come. Not a progression item.
- Fireworks, entry path: everything is early-game; the phantom membrane needs a few sleepless nights, and the other three pictures don't.
- Fireworks, required vs optional: purely celebratory, all year, reachable solo.
- Lanterns, input producer: paper (sugar cane), string (spiders), candles, dyes, an anvil; for mooncakes, wheat, sugar, eggs, the Kitchen Garden's beans, the festival crops' roasted chestnuts, pumpkins and the Cooking Pot.
- Lanterns, output consumer: gatherings: the Halloween events, the harvest feast to come, and any celebration. Luck (vanilla's: better loot rolls and fishing) for everyone at a festival or under a full moon. Not a progression item.
- Lanterns, entry path: everything is early-game; the Cooking Pot is the Kitchen Garden's first station.
- Lanterns, required vs optional: purely celebratory, all year, reachable solo (one player can let eight go).
- Crows and the plans: [AGRICULTURE.md](../branches/AGRICULTURE.md) promised that the scarecrow would one day keep crop-eating birds away; it now does.
- Cider mill and the plans:
  - [AGRICULTURE.md](../branches/AGRICULTURE.md) plans orchards (slice 4) and a Fruit and Seed Press (apples into cider, grapes into juice, seed oil for engineers).
  - The apple tree is the first orchard tree, on the chestnut tree's pattern (now a shared `FruitingLeavesBlock`).
  - The Cider Press is the apple half of that press. Grapes and seed oil are not built.

## Balance and automation
- No energy. A pot costs seven copper ingots. A candle costs one string and one measure of wax a layer: half a honeycomb of beeswax, or one rotten flesh of tallow. A dye, a scent, a glowstone dust or a redstone is used once per pot of wax, however many layers that wax makes (up to eight).
- Units: wax in **measures** (a pot holds 8); burn time in ticks (20 a second).

| | Beeswax layer | Tallow layer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Measures from one item | 2 (a honeycomb) | 1 (a rotten flesh) |
| Burn time | 4,800 ticks (4 min) | 2,400 ticks (2 min) |
| Brightened (×0.5) | 2,400 ticks | 1,200 ticks |
| Long-burning (×1.5) | 7,200 ticks | 3,600 ticks |
| Both | 3,600 ticks | 1,800 ticks |

- A candle's burn time is the sum of its layers' times, so a candle of mixed layers burns for each layer's own time.
- Radius and light by layers: 5, 8, 12 and 16 blocks; light 8, 10, 12 and 14.
- Melting: a measure every 100 ticks over heat; setting: a measure every 300 ticks without heat; cooling between dips: 40 ticks.
- **Effects:**
  - Every 80 ticks, a lit candle gives players in range 180 ticks of each scent's effect: level I, or level II when brightened.
  - Warding gives hostile mobs Slowness (level II when bright) and Weakness I.
  - Revealing gives other creatures Glowing.
  - None of these stack between candles: two candles of the same scent only refresh the same effect.
  - Compared with a beacon, a candle reaches less far (16 blocks at most against a beacon's 20 to 50), lasts minutes rather than for ever, and costs wax and string each time. In return it needs no pyramid and gives two effects at level II from one candle.
- **Harvest:**
  - Each pulse gives radius² ÷ 4 random ticks (twice as many when bright) to random spots within the radius and two blocks above or below the candle. A spot is ticked only if it holds a plant that takes bone meal and random ticks.
  - That is 6, 16, 36 or 64 a pulse by size, spread over the area. Each plant in range gets roughly a fifth more growth ticks than the world gives it (about two fifths when bright), at any size of candle.
  - Several harvest candles add up, each burning its own wax.
- **No positive-gain loop.**
  - A candle never turns back into wax, scents or anything else; burned out, it is gone. The pot makes nothing but candles.
  - The harvest aura only speeds growth that bone meal could give anyway: vanilla already lets crops be composted into bone meal. A candle spends wax and string to spread that over time, and gives no item of its own.
- Automation: candles are dipped by hand (a player's use and cooldown), so the pot can't be automated. Lit candles need no attention until they burn out.

- **Cider mill:**
  - Costs:
    - the press: four planks, an iron ingot, a grindstone and three wooden slabs;
    - the barrel: a barrel, two iron nuggets, a gold nugget and two sticks.
  - Units: juice and cider in **servings** (a bottle each). An apple gives one serving of juice, and the press a pomace for every two apples (rounded up). The trough holds 8 servings, the barrel 16.
  - Time:
    - a crank or screw turn every 8 ticks at most; a cheese takes 4 turns;
    - fruit: a stage every 10 random ticks on average, two stages (about a Minecraft day), 1 to 3 apples a pick;
    - the barrel: sparkling at 24,000 ticks (a day, 20 minutes) after the last fresh serving, aged at 72,000 (three days, an hour).
  - Food:
    - a raw apple is 4 food; its serving of Sweet Cider is 3 (with 30 s of Haste) and half a pomace;
    - ageing adds food (aged cider 4) and a better effect for time, not material.
  - Effects are level I. Aged Cider's two minutes of Absorption match a golden apple's Absorption (without its Regeneration). A barrel makes sixteen, but only after three days and only from apples. This is open to balance review in play.
  - **Bottles are never made from nothing:**
    - the press turns a bottle into a cider;
    - the barrel gives a bottle back for each serving poured in and takes one for each drawn off;
    - every cider leaves its bottle when drunk.
    - Only Sweet Cider gives its bottle back in a recipe (the donuts). Sparkling Cider doesn't, because the Cooking Pot hands back crafting remainders and the mulled cider keeps that bottle.
    - The checker refuses a drink that gives its bottle back and cooks into another bottled drink.
  - **No positive-gain loop.** Nothing turns back into apples. Pomace makes one seed; seeds make trees, which need land and time as any orchard does.
  - Automation: grinding, pressing and bottling are by hand (a player's use); a barrel ages by itself. Comparators read both.

- **Pantry:**
  - Costs:
    - three Mason Jars: five glass and an iron nugget;
    - a kettle: a cauldron, a blue dye and iron bars;
    - a shelf: six wooden slabs and two planks.
  - Units: a jar is **four servings**.
  - Food (a jar's four servings, against what goes in):
    - jam: 12, from six sweet berries (12);
    - apple butter: 16, from three apples and a sweet cider (15);
    - cranberry preserves: 12, from six cranberries (12);
    - jelly: 8, from six glow berries (12), with Night Vision;
    - pumpkin butter: 16, from a pumpkin, which isn't food raw (vanilla's pumpkin pie gives 8);
    - pickles: 8, from four beetroot (4) or four peppers;
    - corn relish: 12, from two corn, a pepper and an onion.
    - Cooking adds a little, as vanilla's cooking does; the real gain is that sealed food keeps and stacks.
  - Time:
    - 300 ticks in the pot for preserves, 200 for vinegar;
    - the kettle boils after 200 ticks over heat and seals a jar after 400 at the boil;
    - an unsealed or opened jar keeps 72,000 ticks (three days).
  - **No container from nothing.**
    - A jar goes into every preserve and comes back after the last serving.
    - Vinegar's bottle comes back when it pickles; aged cider's bottle carries into the vinegar.
    - Sealing changes no item count.
  - Automation:
    - The Cooking Pot already takes hoppers, so preserves can be cooked automatically.
    - The kettle and shelf are filled and emptied by hand.

- **Crows:**
  - Costs: a scarecrow is a hay bale, a wool and three sticks; a head is a pumpkin (carved, jack o'lantern, or hand-carved and lit).
  - Units: blocks across and growth stages.
  - A raid sets a ripe crop back three growth stages (wheat from 7 back to 4: three sevenths of its growing). A crow pecks for 40 ticks, then rests 600 to 1,200 ticks, so it raids once or twice a minute; a flock of three, three to six crops a minute, if no one is near and no scarecrow guards them.
  - Guarded area: 4 blocks across (about 50 blocks of field), 8 (about 200) and 12 (about 450).
  - **No positive-gain loop:** crows don't breed and aren't bred; a crow gives 0 to 2 feathers once and nothing else; feathers make no crows.
  - Automation: a scarecrow works on its own, all day, and needs nothing.

- **Fireworks:**
  - Costs: three rockets from a paper, 1 to 3 gunpowder and the picture's ingredients (as vanilla's three rockets from a paper and gunpowder), and a glowstone dust to twinkle. The launcher: a dispenser, three iron ingots, four planks and a redstone.
  - Units: flight in ticks: 10 for each flight level plus one, and up to 12 more (flight 1: 20 to 32 ticks).
  - A burst is one picture of 87 to 117 sparks and sixteen loose ones, each lasting two to three seconds.
  - Nothing is made back from a rocket: it is gone when it bursts. No damage, so no use as a weapon.
  - Automation: dispensers and the launcher both fire them, by redstone; hoppers load the launcher.

- **Sky lanterns:**
  - Costs: two lanterns from five paper, two string and a candle; a dye to colour one. A festival's eight lanterns are four crafts: 20 paper, 8 string and 4 candles.
  - Units: a lantern rises 0.035 blocks a tick and drifts 0.015, the wind's direction turning full circle every 72,000 ticks; it burns 2,400 to 3,000 ticks and dims over the last 100.
  - The festival: 8 lanterns within 32 blocks in 2,400 ticks; Luck for 6,000 ticks; one festival a place a day (24,000 ticks).
  - Nothing is made back: a lantern is gone when it burns out, torn or not. The reward is an effect and an advancement, never an item, so there is no loop.
- **Mooncakes:**
  - Costs: four cakes from two wheat, a sugar, an egg and the filling, in 300 ticks in the Cooking Pot.
  - 3 food each, saturation modifier 0.6. Luck for 6,000 ticks, only outdoors on a full-moon night: one night in eight.

## Multiplayer and persistence
- **Server authority:**
  - Putting things in the pot, dipping, pouring, lighting and snuffing all go through vanilla's block use path (reach, spawn protection, adventure mode) and are decided on the server.
  - The server checks the wax kind and the pot's room, that the wax is molten, the two-scent limit, and whether brightener or extender is already in.
  - The cooldown ("still warm") is the server's own record of the player's item cooldowns. A client can't dip faster, or keep a warm layer, by claiming otherwise.
- **The aura is worked out on the server** at each pulse, from the candle's saved mixture, over a bounded box. Clients are sent the candle's mixture (to draw its colour, height and flame) and a block event for the ring; they decide nothing.
- **Concurrent use:** two players at one pot each take their own measure; the pot's room and molten count are checked on every use. The cooldown is shared by all of a player's Aura Candles (it is per item), so a player dips one candle at a time.
- **Persistence:**
  - The pot saves its wax, set and molten measures, melting progress, dye sums, scents, brightener and extender.
  - A candle saves its mixture (`mix`: wax, layers, colour, scents, bright, lasting, burn and burned) and keeps it as the item component `jugcraft:candle` when it is broken, along with its colour and name.
  - A pot's wax is lost when the pot is broken.
- **Chunk unload:** a candle in an unloaded chunk doesn't tick, so it neither burns nor pulses until the chunk loads again. No chunk loading.
- **Bounded work:**
  - An unlit candle doesn't tick.
  - A lit one counts down each tick and pulses every 80 ticks: one entity query over at most a 33-block box, plus at most 128 block lookups for a bright harvest candle.
  - A pot ticks only while it holds wax.
- **IDs:**
  - Blocks with items: `jugcraft:wax_melting_pot`, `jugcraft:aura_candle`.
  - Block entities of the same names.
  - The data component `jugcraft:candle`.
  - Item tags: `jugcraft:candle_wax/beeswax`, `jugcraft:candle_wax/tallow`, `jugcraft:candle_scents/<scent>` (eleven), `jugcraft:candle_brighteners`, `jugcraft:candle_extenders`.
  - All are new; nothing earlier is renamed.
- **Disable behaviour:** with the agriculture feature disabled the pot's recipe doesn't load; the blocks, items, component and block entities stay registered, so placed pots and candles stay in the world.

- **Cider mill, server authority:**
  - Putting apples in, cranking, turning the screw, bottling, filling and drawing the barrel go through vanilla's block use path (reach, spawn protection, adventure mode) and are decided on the server.
  - The press checks room, that it isn't mid-pressing, that the trough has room for the turn, and its own pacing. The pacing is per press, not per player: two players can't grind faster than one.
  - Picking apples goes through the same path, as the chestnut's does.
- **Cider mill, persistence:**
  - The press saves its apples, pulp, turns, cheese and juice, and sends them to clients for the renderer (they decide nothing).
  - The barrel saves its servings and the game time its batch started; a broken barrel keeps both as the item component `jugcraft:barrel_cider`.
  - Ageing is worked out from the world's game time, which every dimension shares. So a barrel ages while unloaded or carried, and needs no ticking; it only looks every 20 ticks to change its chalk mark (one comparison).
- **Cider mill, IDs:**
  - blocks with items `apple_leaves`, `cider_press` and `cider_barrel`; the block `apple_sapling` (planted from `apple_seeds`);
  - items `apple_seeds`, `apple_pomace`, `sweet_cider`, `sparkling_cider`, `aged_cider`, `mulled_cider`, `mulling_spices` and `apple_cider_donut`;
  - block entities `cider_press` and `cider_barrel`; the data component `jugcraft:barrel_cider`;
  - item tags `jugcraft:cider_apples` and `c:seeds/apple`;
  - worldgen feature `jugcraft:apple_tree` and placed feature `jugcraft:patch_apple_tree`;
  - the Cooking Pot recipe `jugcraft:pot_cooking/mulled_cider`.
  - All are new. The chestnut leaves' fruiting moved into the shared `FruitingLeavesBlock` with no change of ID, state or behaviour (the festival tests still check it).
- **Cider mill, disable behaviour:** with the agriculture feature off, the recipes don't load and wild apple trees don't generate; the blocks, items, component and block entities stay registered.

- **Pantry, server authority:**
  - Filling, adding jars, lifting them out, draining, and using the shelf go through vanilla's block use path and are decided on the server.
  - The kettle checks for water, room, and that a jar is full and unsealed.
  - Spoiling is checked on the server when a serving is eaten, from the jar's stored time and the world's game time; a client can't freshen a jar.
- **Pantry, persistence:**
  - The kettle saves its water, heat, jars and how long each has been processed. The shelf saves its jars. Both send them to clients to draw, and both spill their jars when broken.
  - A jar's state is two components: `jugcraft:sealed` (a sealed jar) and `jugcraft:jar_contents` (servings left and when it was cooked or opened).
  - The Cooking Pot stamps a cooked jar with the game time. That is the only change to the pot: it builds the meal before using the ingredients, so a stamped jar that can't stack in the result slots waits rather than being lost.
- **Pantry, IDs:**
  - blocks with items `canning_kettle` and `pantry_shelf`, with block entities of the same names;
  - items `mason_jar`, `cider_vinegar`, `sweet_berry_jam`, `apple_butter`, `pumpkin_butter`, `cranberry_preserves`, `glow_berry_jelly`, `pickled_beets`, `pickled_peppers` and `corn_relish`;
  - data components `jugcraft:sealed` and `jugcraft:jar_contents`;
  - Cooking Pot recipes `pot_cooking/<preserve>` and `pot_cooking/cider_vinegar`.
  - All are new.
- **Pantry, disable behaviour:** with the agriculture feature off, the recipes don't load; blocks, items and components stay registered.

- **Crows, server authority:** crows are server-side mobs; where they fly, which crop they pick, their pecking, fleeing and leaving, and the scarecrow checks are all decided on the server. Clients are sent the crow's position and whether it is pecking, to draw it; they decide nothing.
- **Crows, persistence:**
  - Crows are ambient mobs, as bats are: they despawn when no player is within 128 blocks, and in time when none is within 32. A crow's crop, rest and fleeing aren't saved; a crow loaded again just looks again.
  - A crop changes only when a crow standing on it has pecked for two seconds, in a loaded chunk.
  - Scarecrows save nothing new; a scarecrow's guard comes from its head, which it already saved.
- **Crows, bounded work:**
  - The spawner runs every 200 ticks: for each player, one entity count and at most 16 heightmap lookups.
  - A crow looks for a crop every 20 ticks while not resting: 24 heightmap lookups within 12 blocks.
  - Each crop it considers, and the crop it is after every 10 ticks, is checked against scarecrows: the block entities of the loaded chunks within 12 blocks (at most nine chunks).
  - Nothing loads a chunk (`isLoaded`, `getChunkNow`).
- **Crows, IDs:** the entity `jugcraft:crow`, its loot table `jugcraft:entities/crow` and texture `jugcraft:textures/entity/crow.png`. All new; the scarecrow keeps its ID and states.
- **Crows, disable behaviour:** with the agriculture feature off, no crows come, and crows already about fly off as at nightfall; the entity stays registered, so a saved crow loads.

- **Fireworks, server authority:** the server spawns, moves and bursts every rocket, and runs every show (loading, starting and stopping go through vanilla's block use path or redstone). A burst is one small message to the players who can see the rocket (`jugcraft:spooky_burst`: where, which picture, whether it twinkles); each client draws it. Clients decide nothing.
- **Fireworks, persistence:** a rocket saves its flight and how long it has flown; the launcher saves its tubes, whether a show is running and where it is in it.
- **Fireworks, bounded work:** a launcher ticks only while a show runs; a rocket ticks as any projectile; a burst is drawn on the client from one message.
- **Fireworks, IDs:** items `bat_firework`, `pumpkin_firework`, `ghost_firework` and `skull_firework`; block with item `show_launcher` and its block entity; entity `spooky_rocket`; particle `jugcraft:spooky_spark`; data component `jugcraft:twinkle`; the network message `jugcraft:spooky_burst`; 24 rocket recipes and the launcher's. All new.
- **Fireworks, disable behaviour:** with the agriculture feature off, the recipes don't load; everything stays registered.
- **Lanterns, server authority:** the server lets every lantern go (through vanilla's item use path, using one up), moves it and burns it out. The festival is counted on the server from its own record of releases, and the Luck, message and advancement are given there. A mooncake's Luck is decided on the server from the Overworld clock and whether the sky is open above the eater. Clients are sent a lantern's position, colour and when it burns out, to draw it; they decide nothing.
- **Lanterns, persistence:** a lantern saves its colour and when it burns out; its wish is its name. The festival's count is kept in memory only (at most 256 recent releases, and the last day's festivals): a restart forgets it, so a festival under way starts its count again, and a place could hold a second festival the same day after a restart.
- **Lanterns, bounded work:** a lantern ticks like any entity, one fixed step a tick, and is tracked by clients within 10 chunks. Each release looks once through at most 256 remembered releases. Nothing loads a chunk.
- **Lanterns, IDs:** item `sky_lantern` and entity `sky_lantern`; items `red_bean_mooncake`, `chestnut_mooncake` and `pumpkin_mooncake`; advancement `lantern_festival`; the lantern's recipe and the three Cooking Pot recipes. All new.
- **Lanterns, disable behaviour:** with the agriculture feature off, the recipes don't load; lanterns already made can still be let go, and everything stays registered.

## Dependencies and assets
No new dependencies. Every texture is drawn by code (`tools/chandlery_textures.py`): the pot's hammered copper and dark inside, the brass dish, the wax (pale, tinted by its colour as it is drawn), the wax's surface in the pot, the flame (white at its heart, tinted by its scent) and the candle's item in two layers (its body, tinted by its dyed colour; its wick and dish, not). The models, blockstates, item model, names, tooltip, messages, loot and tags come from `tools/chandlery_data.py`; the numbers from `CHANDLERY` in `tools/agriculture.py`. The client's `WaxPotRenderer` draws the wax in the pot at its level and colour; `AuraCandleRenderer` draws the candle at its height, layers and colour and its flame; both share `TintedBoxes`. The item's colour is the vanilla `dyed_color` component, read by the item model's dye tint. Sounds are vanilla's (honeycomb waxing, dye use, brewing, a bottle filling, a honey slide, a bucket emptying, a candle going out).

The cider mill:
- Textures are drawn by code in `tools/cider_textures.py`: the leaves at each stage, the sapling, the press's oak, slats and iron, the barrel's staves along and across, its head with each chalk mark, its brass, the pulp, juice and apple skin for the renderer, and the items. The bottles share the treats' bottle shape.
- The models, blockstates, loot, tags, worldgen and words come from `tools/cider_data.py`; the numbers from `CIDER` in `tools/agriculture.py`.
- The client's `CiderPressRenderer` draws the press's apples, pulp, plate, screw, capstan bar and juice (with `TintedBoxes`). The barrel is a block model with a variant for each chalk mark.
- Sounds are vanilla's (an item frame's click, a grindstone, a trapdoor's creak, a bucket, bottles).

The pantry:
- Textures are drawn by code in `tools/pantry_textures.py`: the kettle's speckled enamel, inside and rack, the shelf's oak and beadboard, the water, a jar's glass, lid and gingham, and each preserve's jar, plain and sealed.
- Models, the items' sealed-or-not models (a `minecraft:condition` on `jugcraft:sealed`), loot, tags and words come from `tools/pantry_data.py`; the numbers from `PANTRY` in `tools/agriculture.py`.
- The client's `CanningKettleRenderer` and `PantryShelfRenderer` draw the water and jars (with `PreserveJars` and `TintedBoxes`).
- Sounds are vanilla's (buckets, bottles, a chiseled bookshelf's slot, eating).

Crows:
- The texture is drawn by code in `tools/crow_textures.py`: glossy blue-black feathers with a lighter sheen along the wings' edges, a dark grey beak and feet, and pale yellow eyes.
- Its name and loot come from `tools/crow_data.py`; the numbers from `CROWS` in `tools/agriculture.py`.
- The client's `CrowModel` (head and beak, body, two wings that spread and beat in flight and fold while it pecks, a fanned tail, legs) and `CrowRenderer` draw it.
- Sounds are vanilla's: a parrot's call, pitched down, for its caw; crops breaking when it has pecked.

Fireworks:
- Textures are drawn by code in `tools/firework_textures.py`: each rocket's item, the launcher's stained crate with iron corners, its painted tubes and their mouths, the brass dial at each mode, a rocket's paper, and the soft star of a spark.
- The pictures are pixel pictures in `FireworkShape.java`, which the client reads to draw a burst (`SpookyBursts`, `SpookySparkParticle`). The launcher's loaded rockets are drawn by `ShowLauncherRenderer`; a rocket in flight by vanilla's thrown-item renderer.
- Models, blockstates, recipes, loot, tags and words come from `tools/firework_data.py`; the numbers from `FIREWORKS` in `tools/agriculture.py`.
- Sounds are vanilla's fireworks' (launch, blast near and far, twinkle).

Sky lanterns:
- Textures are drawn by code in `tools/lantern_textures.py`: the lantern's item in two layers (its paper, pale so the dye tints it, and, untinted, its bamboo ring and flame), the rice paper the client wraps a lantern in, and each mooncake (a scalloped golden cake pressed with a flower, a wedge cut away to show its filling).
- A lantern in flight is drawn by `SkyLanternRenderer`: its paper body on its ring, glowing at full brightness and flickering, dimming as it burns out.
- Models, the recipe, the `minecraft:dyeable` tag and words come from `tools/lantern_data.py`; the mooncakes' Cooking Pot recipes from `POT_RECIPES`; the numbers from `LANTERNS` in `tools/agriculture.py`.
- Sounds are vanilla's (flint and steel to light one, a fire going out when one is torn).

## Verification
### Chandlery verification

Actual results (2 October 2026, Minecraft 26.3, Fabric Loader 0.19.3, Fabric API 0.161.0+26.3, Temurin JDK 25.0.4, GitHub Actions), on `claude/agriculture-halloween-decor-15` stacked on batch 14:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 scripts/check_repository.py` | Pass |
| `python3 tools/check_mod_data.py` (now also compares the chandlery's numbers, waxes and scents with Java: capacity, timings, scent limit, burn factors, layers, pulse and effect time, harvest divisor, radii and light by layers, each wax's measures, burn and colour, each scent's effect and colour; checks every wax and scent tag, and the brightener and extender tags, hold `tools/agriculture.py`'s items; that the candle's blockstate has a variant for every state; and that every pot message, candle tooltip, candle name, wax and scent has its words) | Pass, 581 IDs |
| `./gradlew build` on `1cdcf09` (Build workflow run 37021364812) | Pass on its second attempt (see the next row) |
| Game tests on the headless server, same run: 336 in total, 8 of them new here (`ChandleryGameTests`) | **All 336 pass** on the second attempt. The first attempt failed one test from `main`, `PetroGameTests.heliostatsHeatASolarReceiver` ("The receiver made 48 JE/t, expected 36 on tick 25"), which this branch doesn't touch; the same tests had all passed on `f56071b` (run 37020041265), and the failed job was re-run once |
| Client game test (real client, Mesa software rendering, CI job `client`) | **Passes** on `1cdcf09`, with the screenshots above. No model or texture errors for the chandlery in the log |

The 8 new game tests (`ChandleryGameTests`):
1. honeycomb melts over a campfire and stays set on stone; a pot of beeswax takes no tallow;
2. molten wax takes red, then blue dye (and mixes them), two scents but not a third, glowstone dust and redstone once each;
3. string starts a scented one-layer candle and uses a measure; dipped again while warm, the layer slides off and its wax is lost; a cool candle gains a layer and its burn time adds up; layering a third scent muddles a candle;
4. a pulse gives players within five blocks both effects and a player six blocks off none; a bright candle gives Speed II; a muddled candle gives nothing;
5. warding slows and weakens a zombie; revealing makes the zombie glow, but not a player;
6. a bright harvest candle's pulses grow the wheat round it;
7. flint and steel lights a candle (light 8 for one layer); a lit candle burns down and goes out for good, its block entity with it; broken part-burned, a candle drops itself with its mixture and burn;
8. the pot's recipe and both loot tables load.

Found by CI and fixed before this record:
- 26.3's `LivingEntity.drop` takes a third argument; a candle that doesn't fit in the inventory pops out of the pot instead (`e61fa32`).
- 26.3 has no `RenderTypes.entityCutoutNoCull`; the renderers use `entityCutout`, wind each face to face along its normal, and draw a flame's plane from both sides (`7ee4afb`).
- 26.3's entity types are constants of `EntityTypes`, not `EntityType` (`5935bc2`).
- A test swapped the glowstone dust in hand for redstone before counting it (a test bug, not the pot's); each is now checked while it is held (`f56071b`).
- The first screenshots showed the flames as thin slivers in the scent's colour, lost against wax of the same colour; they are now about twice the size with a warm-white heart (`1cdcf09`).

**Not run:**
- a person playing it in a client: dipping by hand, watching the cooldown, walking in and out of an aura;
- a dedicated server with two players at one pot, or in one aura;
- how long a harvest candle takes to grow a real farm (the test drives 400 pulses at once);
- the sounds (the CI client has no sound device).

### Cider mill verification

Actual results (2 October 2026, Minecraft 26.3, Fabric Loader 0.19.3, Fabric API 0.161.0+26.3, Temurin JDK 25.0.4, GitHub Actions), on `claude/agriculture-halloween-decor-16` stacked on the chandlery:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 scripts/check_repository.py` | Pass |
| `python3 tools/check_mod_data.py` (now also compares the cider mill with Java: the apple leaves' fruiting and picking, the press's capacity, trough, turns, pacing and pomace, the barrel's capacity, ageing times and stages; checks the apple tag, the press's, barrel's and leaves' block states, the barrel's chalk-mark states, every message, the barrel's loot keeping its cider, the apple tree's biomes and that apple seeds plant a known sapling; and refuses a drink that gives its bottle back but cooks into another bottled drink) | Pass, 593 IDs |
| `./gradlew build` on `c01a4a2` (Build workflow run 37025266440) | Pass |
| Game tests on the headless server, same run: 345 in total, 9 of them new here (`CiderGameTests`) | **All 345 pass** |
| Client game test (real client, Mesa software rendering, CI job `client`) | **Passes** on `c01a4a2`, with the screenshots in [AGRICULTURE.md](../branches/AGRICULTURE.md#the-cider-mill). No model or texture errors for the cider mill in the log. Like every Jugcraft machine and Cooking Pot recipe, the mulled cider recipe is logged as one the vanilla recipe book can't place (the recipe book only knows vanilla recipe types) |

The 9 new game tests (`CiderGameTests`):
1. an apple sapling grows a tree: an oak trunk and a crown of apple leaves;
2. tree-grown leaves blossom and ripen; placed leaves don't; picking drops apples and leaves bare leaves;
3. eight apples go in and not a ninth; a crank turn grinds one, a second at once does nothing, and once free the crank grinds another;
4. four screw turns press a full cheese: a quarter of the juice each, no apples in while pressing, four pomace knocked out, the screw free again; a bottle draws sweet cider; comparators read the juice;
5. a cheese of three apples gives exactly three servings and two pomace;
6. sweet cider goes into a barrel and the bottles come back; after a day it is sparkling (the chalk mark follows) and takes no fresh juice; a bottle draws sparkling cider; after three days it is aged; broken, it keeps its servings and start time;
7. topping up a sweet batch starts its day again;
8. every cider is drunk on a full stomach, leaves its bottle and gives its effect; sweet cider gives its bottle back in a recipe and sparkling cider doesn't;
9. the recipes (mulled cider in the Cooking Pot among them), loot tables and the apple tree's placed feature load, and sparkling cider with spices finds the mulled cider recipe.

Found by CI and fixed before this record:
- The press started with its last work at `Long.MIN_VALUE`, so "now minus then" overflowed and a new press never turned its crank. The first run's `pressGrindsApplesIntoPulp` caught it (344 of 345 passed); it now starts a work interval in the past (`3d1751a`).
- The first screenshots showed the barrels as square crates; three stepped boxes now round their profile (`c01a4a2`).

**Not run (cider mill):**
- a person playing it in a client: grinding and pressing by hand, drinking;
- a dedicated server with two players at one press;
- a real day of ageing (the tests set the barrel's start time back);
- wild apple trees in a new world (the test grows one from a sapling, and checks the placed feature loads);
- the sounds.

- Holding anything but a jar, using the shelf fell through to the empty-hand action, so a stick took a jar down; the shelf and kettle now answer only an empty hand. `pantryShelfHoldsSixJars` caught it (352 of 353 passed) (`55ff342`).
- The first screenshots showed the kettle under a cloud of steam; the steam is now a few small wisps (`b801521`).

The 8 new game tests (`PantryGameTests`):
1. jam cooks into a jar in the Cooking Pot, full, unsealed and stamped with when it was cooked; beets pickle in cider vinegar, and the vinegar's bottle stays in the pot;
2. a jar is eaten a serving at a time (2 food each for the jelly), the last leaving the empty jar; the jelly gives Night Vision;
3. an unsealed jar over three days old has spoiled (1 food, Hunger and Nausea); a sealed jar of the same age is fine, and opening it starts its days;
4. sealed jars of a preserve stack, unsealed jars from different batches don't;
5. the kettle takes no jar without water, fills from a water bucket, refuses an opened jar, takes fresh ones; at the boil both seal after twenty seconds; comparators read them; an empty hand lifts them out sealed;
6. off the heat the kettle stops boiling and nothing seals; sneaking lifts the jar out unsealed;
7. a shelf holds six jars and refuses a seventh and a stick; a full shelf reads 15; an empty hand takes one down; broken, it spills the rest;
8. the recipes (every preserve and the vinegar in the Cooking Pot) and loot tables load.

**Not run (pantry):**
- a person playing it in a client: cooking, canning and eating;
- a dedicated server with two players at one kettle;
- a real three days of spoiling (the tests set the time back);
- the sounds.

### Crows verification

Actual results (2 October 2026, Minecraft 26.3, Fabric Loader 0.19.3, Fabric API 0.161.0+26.3, Temurin JDK 25.0.4, GitHub Actions), on `claude/agriculture-halloween-decor-18` stacked on the preserves pantry:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 scripts/check_repository.py` | Pass |
| `python3 tools/check_mod_data.py` (now also compares the crows and scarecrows with Java: the crow's flight, fleeing, raiding, pecking, setback, rest, nightfall and look intervals, the spawner's timing, distances, flock and caps, the scarecrows' guard radii and height, the crow's health; checks the crow is registered with its attributes, named, and drops feathers) | Pass, 605 IDs (crows add an entity, not an item or block) |
| `./gradlew build` on `71d42ef` (Build workflow run 37037813700) | Pass |
| Game tests on the headless server, same run: 361 in total, 8 of them new here (`CrowGameTests`) | **All 361 pass**. They also all passed on `c2d093b` (run 37033625474) and `85e6c36` (run 37036340295). Run 37034790416, on a commit that changed only the client test, failed once on `main`'s `PetroGameTests.heliostatsHeatASolarReceiver` ("The receiver made 48 JE/t, expected 36 on tick 25"), which this branch doesn't touch; its re-run passed |
| Client game test (real client, Mesa software rendering, CI job `client`) | **Passes** on `71d42ef` (run 37037813700), with the screenshots in [AGRICULTURE.md](../branches/AGRICULTURE.md#crows-and-working-scarecrows): five crows on the client, one of them pecking for real. No model or texture errors for the crow in the log |

The 8 new game tests (`CrowGameTests`):
1. a bare scarecrow guards 4 blocks across and not 5, and 6 blocks up or down but not 7; wearing a carved pumpkin, 8 and not 9; wearing a jack o'lantern, 12;
2. sent after ripe wheat, a crow lands and pecks; halfway through, the wheat is still ripe; after two seconds it is three stages back and the crow is done, and won't go for the unripe wheat;
3. with its own AI (by day), a crow three blocks above flies down to the wheat it was sent after and pecks it back;
4. a scarecrow going up beside the wheat a crow is pecking sends it off within half a second, the wheat spared; no other crow goes after a guarded crop;
5. a sneaking player four blocks off doesn't scare a pecking crow; standing up, the player does, and it flies away from them; with no one near another crow pecks, and a blow sends it off;
6. at nightfall a crow leaves its crop and climbs, and is gone once high over the ground;
7. the spawner finds ripe wheat open to the sky, not under a glass roof, and brings a flock of two or three crows in the sky above it;
8. a crow killed by a player drops at most two feathers; its loot table loads.

Found by CI and fixed before this record:
- The spawner test's field was under the game test's barrier ceiling, which crows rightly took for a roof; the test now lifts it, and checks that a glass roof keeps crows off (`c2d093b`). The other tests passed first time.
- In the client test the scarecrow broke itself on farmland, which has no solid top, and the pecking crow was hidden in tall wheat; the scarecrow now stands on grass and the crow pecks carrots at the front of the patch (`0c18542`, `85e6c36`, `71d42ef`).

**Not run (crows):**
- a person playing it in a client: crows coming to a real farm, scaring them off, building scarecrows round a field;
- a dedicated server with two players;
- how often crows come to a real farm over a day (the tests call the spawner directly), or how much they set a farm back;
- the sounds.

### Fireworks verification

Actual results (2 October 2026, Minecraft 26.3, Fabric Loader 0.19.3, Fabric API 0.161.0+26.3, Temurin JDK 25.0.4, GitHub Actions), on `claude/agriculture-halloween-decor-19` stacked on the crows:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 scripts/check_repository.py` | Pass |
| `python3 tools/check_mod_data.py` (now also compares the fireworks with Java: the rocket's flight base, spread and climb, the launcher's tubes, tube size, sequence and volley steps and both leans; checks every picture has its firework item, named and drawn, with a recipe for each flight, plain and twinkling, making three of that flight; the launcher's models for every facing and mode, its words, loot and recipe; the spark particle, the burst payload and the dispensing are registered) | Pass, 610 IDs |
| `./gradlew build` on `d035ac4` (Build workflow run 37038322733) | Pass |
| Game tests on the headless server, same run | **All pass**. On `f869aa1` (run 37037699738), the last commit to change the game tests, the count was 369, 8 of them new here (`FireworkGameTests`); `d035ac4` changes only the client test |
| Client game test (real client, Mesa software rendering, CI job `client`) | **Passes** on `d035ac4` (run 37038322733), with the screenshots in [AGRICULTURE.md](../branches/AGRICULTURE.md#spooky-fireworks): four pictures bursting at night, a finale, and a loaded launcher with its rockets' tips showing. No model, texture or particle errors in the log |

The 8 new game tests (`FireworkGameTests`):
1. every picture is well formed, at least 40 sparks, and has a firework that bursts into it with flight 1 when crafted plain; the jack o'lantern has its green stem and holes round it;
2. used on the ground, a ghost firework is used up and goes up alone, flies for its flight's time, is still climbing after half a second and bursts, breaking and hurting nothing;
3. flight 3 flies longer, a twinkling firework twinkles; all 24 firework recipes load, and paper, two gunpowder, a carved pumpkin and glowstone dust make three twinkling flight-2 jack o'lanterns; the launcher's recipe and loot table load;
4. the Show Launcher loads sixteen rockets to a tube, matching tubes first and vanilla rockets in their own; sticks don't load; hoppers load rockets from any side and unload only from below; comparators read the loaded tubes; a full launcher takes no more; broken, it spills every rocket;
5. in sequence a show fires one rocket every half second round the loaded tubes in turn and stops when they are empty;
6. in volleys it fires a row of three every second, front row first, a vanilla rocket in a row going up with it; a finale fires one from every tube at once, each leaning out from the middle, and stops;
7. a rising redstone signal starts a show and the next stops it, and so does an empty hand; sneaking turns the dial; a stick does nothing and an empty launcher won't start;
8. a dispenser facing up sets off a spooky firework.

Found by CI and fixed before this record:
- The spark particle overrode a light method 26.3 doesn't have; it now lights itself at full brightness through `getLightCoords` (`f2e6c83`).
- The recipe test assembled with the older two-argument `assemble`; 26.3's takes only the input (`6af3169`).
- Two mistakes in the tests themselves: the jack o'lantern's stem pixel was looked for in the wrong column, and the "not a rocket" check used dirt, which the use test placed as a block; it now uses a stick (`f869aa1`).
- The first screenshots were too far off to make out the pictures; the camera now stands closer to the launcher and the bursts (`d035ac4`).

**Not run (fireworks):**
- a person playing it in a client: crafting the fireworks, setting them off by hand, loading and running a show;
- a dedicated server with two players, each seeing the pictures face them;
- how a long show looks and runs with many launchers going at once;
- the sounds.

### Lanterns verification

Actual results (2 October 2026, Minecraft 26.3, Fabric Loader 0.19.3, Fabric API 0.161.0+26.3, Temurin JDK 25.0.4, GitHub Actions), on `claude/agriculture-halloween-decor-20` stacked on spooky fireworks:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 scripts/check_repository.py` | Pass |
| `python3 tools/check_mod_data.py` (now also compares the lanterns with Java: the lantern's rise, wind, wind period, lifetime, spread and fade; the festival's count, radius, window, cooldown, Luck and memory; the mooncake's Luck and the night's start and end; checks the lantern is registered, named, dyeable and crafted two at a time, every mooncake is registered with its food and bakes four at a time in the Cooking Pot, and the festival has its message and advancement) | Pass, 614 IDs |
| `./gradlew build` on `53cbeef` (Build workflow run 37038755618) | Pass |
| Game tests on the headless server, same run: 373 in total, 4 of them new here (`LanternGameTests`) | **All 4 lantern tests pass.** One test failed, twice (the run and its one re-run): `main`'s `PetroGameTests.heliostatsHeatASolarReceiver` ("The receiver made 48 JE/t, expected 36 on tick 25"), which this branch doesn't touch and which fails the same way now and then on other branches. On `c3edfea` (run 37037176622) the lantern tests passed too; the only failures there were the two firework test mistakes since fixed on the fireworks branch (`f869aa1`) and merged here |
| Client game test (real client, Mesa software rendering, CI job `client`) | **Passes** on `53cbeef` (run 37038755618) and `c3edfea` (run 37037176622), with the screenshots in [AGRICULTURE.md](../branches/AGRICULTURE.md#the-sky-lantern-festival): eighteen lanterns in seven colours let go together at night, one carrying a wish, and the three mooncakes and a lantern in item frames |

The 4 new game tests (`LanternGameTests`):
1. used, a dyed, named lantern is used up and one lantern goes up, blue and carrying its wish, to burn for two minutes or so; a second later it has risen and drifted with the wind;
2. an undyed lantern is warm red with no wish; it burns bright and dims over its last five seconds; two let go apart drift exactly the same way, rising; one above the world is gone; a blow tears one and puts it out;
3. seven lanterns make no festival, nor an eighth let go too far off; the eighth near makes one, with Luck and A Sky Full of Wishes for the player near; the same place holds no second festival that day;
4. the first and ninth nights are full-moon nights, and noon, the second night and dawn aren't; the three mooncake recipes load; wheat, sugar, an egg and roasted chestnuts bake four chestnut mooncakes; a mooncake is three food.

Found by CI and fixed before this record: nothing in the lanterns; their tests passed on their first run.

**Not run (lanterns):**
- a person playing it in a client: letting lanterns go, watching a festival, eating a mooncake under a real full moon (the test checks the full-moon reckoning and the food, not the Luck from eating one at night);
- a dedicated server with two or more players letting lanterns go together;
- a server restart in the middle of a festival's count;
- the sounds.

## World and event applicability
- Candles and pots work anywhere, in every dimension, all year. Nothing is seasonal. The aura doesn't depend on biome, time or weather; harvest helps only plants that would grow there anyway.
- Revealing shows creatures through walls (Glowing), which can help find hostile mobs in caves; it gives no other information.

- Wild apple trees grow in plains and flower-rich biomes (`c:is_plains`, `c:is_floral`), in new chunks only, about one patch in twelve chunks there.
- A barrel ages by game time, so sleeping through the night doesn't age it (sleeping skips the time of day, not game time).

- Crows come to the Overworld only, by day (on the Overworld clock), wherever there are ripe crops open to the sky; they don't depend on the biome or the season.

- Sky lanterns go up in any dimension, all year. A festival counts lanterns in one dimension at a time.

## Rollout and open questions
- The aura's area is a box reaching the radius in every direction, up and down too (a beacon's reaches the whole height of the world).
- Warding works on monsters (zombies, skeletons, creepers, spiders, endermen, witches and the like). Hostile mobs that aren't monsters to the game, such as slimes, magma cubes, phantoms, ghasts, shulkers and hoglins, aren't warded.
- Effects are given to players only, not to tamed animals or villagers.
- Mending gives Regeneration II when bright, to everyone in up to a 33-block box, for as long as the candle burns. That is stronger than a beacon's Regeneration I for a short while and is open to balance review in play.
- The "still warm" cooldown is the item cooldown, so it shows on every Aura Candle in the hotbar, not only the one just dipped.
- A dipped candle goes to the hand that held it if that hand is empty, else into the inventory, else it pops out of the top of the pot.
- A pot's wax is lost when the pot is broken; the pot drops itself.
- Apple leaves take random ticks but not bone meal, so a harvest candle's aura doesn't speed their fruiting.
- The press can't be fed or emptied by hoppers or pipes yet; grinding, pressing and bottling are by hand.
- The press's pacing is per press: a second player at the same press waits as the first does.
- A barrel holds one batch; a fermenting batch takes no fresh juice, so a cider maker uses several barrels.
- Grapes, juices and the seed oil of the planned Fruit and Seed Press are not built.
- Preserves only spoil when unsealed; nothing else in Jugcraft spoils. A jar's three days count game time (sleeping doesn't hasten them).
- The kettle and shelf can't be filled or emptied by hoppers yet.
- A jar can be sealed only full and fresh: an opened jar can't be put up again.
- A spooky firework can't be used in a crossbow (crossbows only take vanilla rockets) or to boost elytra flight.
- A burst is drawn facing each player when it bursts; a player who moves round it while it fades sees it turn edge-on.
- Rockets climb about 15 blocks at flight 1 and 30 to 40 at flight 3, much as vanilla's do.
- Crows peck only crops of the vanilla crop kind (`CropBlock`); tall crops, gourds, bushes and fruit trees are safe.
- A scarecrow's guard is a circle measured across the ground from its head; walls don't block it.
- Crows don't eat crops from storage, trample farmland, or attack. A crop set back keeps its farmland.
- The spawn chances, flock size and caps are first guesses, open to balance review in play.
- Crows use vanilla sounds (a parrot's call pitched down); a crow's own caw would need a new sound file.
- A lantern lights nothing below it: entities can't give off block light, so its glow is drawn, not cast.
- The wind is the same everywhere in a world and turns with game time; weather doesn't change it.
- The festival's memory is the server's alone and is lost on a restart (see Multiplayer and persistence).
- Lanterns can't be let go from a dispenser.
- A mooncake's Luck goes by the Overworld clock's moon wherever it is eaten, and needs only the sky open above the eater; it isn't limited to the Overworld.
