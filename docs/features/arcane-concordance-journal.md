# Arcane Concordance: the Concordance Journal

Status: implemented on branch `claude/concordance-steps-26-32`; see Verification for what has run.
Proposal issue: none; the owner's Arcane Concordance brief (roadmap step 26) is the scope approval.
Owner: @jimbozoomer-byte. AI-assisted implementation with Claude Code; the model is named in the commit trailers.
Target milestone and tier: Concordance milestone 18, every stage (Initiate to Architect). Roadmap step 26.
Primary specialty and supported player role: every player of the Concordance; no tradition of its own.

Builds on every Concordance feature's own report (research, [stages](arcane-concordance-progression.md),
[Vitae](arcane-concordance-vitae.md), [the sky](arcane-concordance-celestial.md), [workers](arcane-concordance-workers.md),
[deliveries](arcane-concordance-logistics.md), [relics](arcane-concordance-relics.md), [curses and
wards](arcane-concordance-hexes.md), [the Conclave](arcane-concordance-conclave.md), [spires](arcane-concordance-spire.md)
and [Prima Materia](arcane-concordance-equivalence.md)). Contract and checklist: [ARCANE_CONCORDANCE.md](../ARCANE_CONCORDANCE.md).

## What already existed, and what this reuses

Every feature already answered for itself: a device with an empty hand, Jade, and a chat command per tradition
(`/jugcraft concordance status`, `stage`, `vitae`, `sky`, `workers`, `logistics`, `relics`, `hexes`, `conclave`,
`spire`). Nothing showed them together, the research status spoke in rule ids (`examine 1/3`), and a stage route's
needs were the graph's own data (`research jugcraft:first_light@mastered`). This step adds no rule: the journal shows
the reports the commands print, each feature still writing its lines once.

The library roles, each with one purpose:

| Library | Role |
|---|---|
| Modonomicon | The codex: what things are and how they work, generated from the same definitions the server uses (`tools/concordance*.py`); a new Foundations page explains the journal. |
| JEI (optional) | Recipes and uses, as before. |
| Jade (optional) | One block at a glance: its state and why it rests, as before. |
| GuiLib (optional) | The journal's workspace. Without GuiLib, the plain journal shows the same. |
| Cloth Config and Mod Menu | The Concordance's settings, now with exact values and the simple journal. |

## Player experience

**J** (Controls: *Concordance Journal*, remappable) opens the journal. It asks the server, which answers with what it
knows of this player now, in sections:

- **Overview**: Focus, the stage reached, how many research entries are met and mastered.
- **Research**: every entry the player has met, its state and what its next state asks, in the words of that state's
  advancement ("Understand circles: study a circle specimen at a Lampwright's Bench"); or which entry must come first.
  Entries not yet met are only counted, never named.
- **Stage**: the stage and, for the next, every route and what it still needs, in words: "First Light mastered",
  "5 entries mastered (you have 2)", "the Conclave rank of Starbound", "a Concord Spire raised, or helped to raise".
- Once their research is met: **Vitae**, **the Sky** (the forecast), **Workers**, **Deliveries**, **Relics**, **Prima
  Materia**; **Curses and Wards** once Sympathy is met or while a curse or ward touches the player; **the Conclave**
  for its members; **Spires** for those who keep one.

**Exact values** add, after a line, the figures behind it: how many of what each way to the next research state needs
("examined 1 of 3; or studied 0 of 1"), and caps. They are off by default; the journal's own switch (or **X**) and the
Concordance settings change it.

**Two screens, the same journal.** With GuiLib installed the journal opens as a workspace (a tab per section, a
scrolling page, the exact-values switch, a refresh button). Without GuiLib, or with **Simple journal** chosen in the
settings, it opens as a plain screen of vanilla buttons.

**Keyboard and accessibility.**

- Tab, Left and Right (or the section buttons) change section.
- Up, Down, Page Up and Page Down (and the mouse wheel) scroll.
- R asks again, X shows or hides exact values, Esc closes.
- Light text on a dark panel; a visible focus ring in the workspace.
- Nothing is said by colour alone: every line says what it means.
- Reduced motion (the Concordance setting) stops the workspace's sliding and its background blur.
- The plain screen's buttons are read by the narrator.
- Both screens follow the game's GUI scale.

The same research report now prints in chat with `/jugcraft concordance status`, in words with its figures after them.

## How it works

**On the server** (`concordance/journal`). `Journal` holds the sections in order, each with when it is shown and the
report that fills it. `Journal.build(player)` reads the server's own records for that player only. `JournalPayload`
carries the result (at most 24 sections of 96 lines: `JournalSection`, `JournalLine` with optional exact figures).
`JournalRequestPayload` carries nothing; the server answers it at most every 10 ticks per player (`RateGate`).

A section whose report fails is replaced by one line saying it could not be read; the server's log says why. The
others still show.

The reports are the features' own, given a sink: `StageProgress.describe`, `Starbound.status` and `commissions`,
`ConcordSpire.describe` and `report`, `Reliquary.report` and `Sympathy.report`, alongside the existing `Vigil.status`,
`Workers.list`, `Couriers.list` and `Sky.forecast`. The commands print through the same methods. `StageProgress.need`
turns the graph's need tokens into words; the pure `Stages.missing` is unchanged.

**On the client.** `JournalClient` registers the key and keeps the last journal received, forgetting it when the
player leaves the world. `JournalScreen` is the plain screen. `JournalWorkspace` (Kotlin, `src/client/kotlin`) is the
GuiLib workspace, with its stylesheet `assets/jugcraft/ui/journal.css`. `JournalClient` opens the workspace only
behind `isModLoaded("guilib")`, so the Kotlin and GuiLib classes are never loaded without GuiLib.

## Connections

- Input producer: every Concordance feature's records (research, stages, Vitae, the sky, workers, the logistics
  ledger, relics, curses and wards, the Conclave, spires, Prima Materia).
- Output consumer: the player; nothing in the game reads the journal.
- Technology connection: deliveries and their stranded cargo; Prima Materia.
- Magic connection: every tradition's state and what it still needs.
- Reachable entry path: the key works from the first moment; a newcomer sees Focus, the stage's first route and how
  much is still unknown.
- Solo, trade and cooperative routes: each player's journal is their own; shared spires and party projects show for
  everyone sharing them.
- Specialty use without other branches: each tradition's section appears only once its research is met.
- Mastery: none (the journal shows progress; it grants nothing).

## Balance

No balance effect: the journal reads; it never records evidence, grants, changes Focus or touches a block.

## Multiplayer and persistence

- Server authority: the client asks; the server decides what that player sees and sends it. The request carries no
  fields to trust.
- Permissions and hidden information: only the asking player's own records; unmet research is counted, not named;
  another player's spire shows only when it is shared with them.
- Rate: one answer per player at most every 10 ticks; at most 24 sections of 96 lines.
- Persistence: nothing new is saved. The client keeps the last journal in memory until the player leaves the world;
  the exact-values and simple-journal choices are this computer's settings (`config/jugcraft-client.properties`).
- Disable behaviour: with `concordance.enabled=false` the journal has one line saying the Concordance is switched off.

## Dependencies and assets

No new dependency. GuiLib (optional, client, pinned 0.12.4) draws the workspace; Kotlin is compiled for that client
screen only, as [FRAMEWORKS.md](../FRAMEWORKS.md) allows, and loads only with GuiLib (which brings Fabric Language
Kotlin). Cloth Config (required) holds the two new settings. No art: the screens are drawn in code and CSS.

## Verification

- `python3 tools/check_mod_data.py`: new step 26 checks (`check_journal`). They confirm:
  - the sections are the generator's, in its order, each titled;
  - every word the journal, the stage report and both screens use has its text (states, rule kinds, milestones);
  - the journal only reads, and the request is rate-limited and carries nothing;
  - the workspace is reached only behind the GuiLib check, and its stylesheet ships.
- Game tests added: `ConcordanceJournalGameTests` (five). They check that a newcomer's research is only counted, that
  met research names its next state with figures, that a tradition's section appears once met, that a stage's needs
  are words, and that the journal survives its encoding to the client.
- Client game test added: `ConcordanceJournalClientGameTests` (the journal crosses from the server and opens, simple
  and GuiLib, with screenshots).
- CI: pending (this record is updated with the run).

Not yet run: a look at the screenshots by a person, the narrator reading the plain screen, the GuiLib workspace's
keyboard navigation by hand, and a two-client server.

## World and event applicability

Works everywhere; no seasonal content.

## Rollout and open questions

New identifiers: the payloads `jugcraft:concordance_journal` and `jugcraft:concordance_journal_request`, the key
`key.jugcraft.concordance_journal`, the codex entry `foundations/journal`, and the client settings
`concordance.exact_values` and `concordance.simple_journal`. Nothing is saved in worlds.

Open items:

- The GuiLib composer, ritual schematic, crucible and observatory screens are still not built. The `compose` command,
  the circle report, the crucible's own report and the forecast are their interfaces.
- The journal shows the stage's routes but not the Conclave project progress of a party (the `conclave project`
  command does).
