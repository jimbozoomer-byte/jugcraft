# Scuba gear, free runners, power weapons and plastic blocks

Status: implemented on `feature/gear-27` (batch 27), stacked on `feature/chemistry-26`, awaiting review. Compiles and tests in CI only; **not yet played**.
Proposal issue: the owner, 2 October 2026, shared Mekanism jars ("lets integrate a bunch of this") and picked "Gear & weapons" from the list Claude offered.
Owner: jimbozoomer-byte
Target milestone and tier: oil and electronics (steel tier and later)
Primary specialty and supported player role: exploring and fighting; plastic blocks for building.
Design inspiration: Mekanism and Mekanism: Additions by aidancbrady and team (MIT): scuba gear, free runners, the Meka-Tana and Meka-Bow, plastic blocks. Mekanism: Weapons by oMeranha (MIT) was also shared. Only the ideas are taken; no code, data or art was copied.

## Player experience
- **Scuba mask and scuba tank.**
  - Worn together (head and chest), they let the player breathe under water.
  - The tank holds 8,000 mB of oxygen. Use it on anything holding oxygen to fill it: a gas holder, or a machine's oxygen tank (the air separation unit, the electrolytic cell).
  - Under water, with the mask on, it keeps the wearer's air full for 1 mB a tick: 400 seconds a tank.
  - Both are light armor (leather-like), mended with rubber.
- **Free runners:** rubber-soled boots.
  - No fall damage at all.
  - Step up a full block without jumping (+0.5 step height).
  - Iron boots' protection; mended with rubber.
- **Power katana:** a sword that runs on JE instead of wearing out.
  - 11 attack damage at 1.8 attacks a second; a netherite sword does 8 at 1.6.
  - 1,000 JE a hit; 200,000 JE full (200 hits). Empty, it hits for 1.
- **Power bow:** a bow that runs on JE.
  - Charged, it fires arrows of energy for 500 JE a shot (100,000 JE full, 200 shots), with no arrows needed.
  - Energy arrows fly 25% faster (3.75 against 3.0) and start from 3 damage against 2, so a full draw hits hard. They cannot be picked up.
  - Empty, it is an ordinary bow that uses the player's arrows.
  - Takes bow enchantments.
- Both weapons charge at the charging station, show an energy bar, and take capacity modules.
- **Plastic blocks in all sixteen dye colours:** eight plastic sheets around a dye make eight. Smooth and bright, as hard as concrete; mined with a pickaxe.
- Four advancements:
  - Deep Breath (scuba gear);
  - Light on Your Feet (free runners);
  - Charged Up (a power weapon);
  - Lego My Ego (plastic blocks).
- Handbook pages: scuba gear, free runners and the power weapons in the Steel chapter; plastic blocks beside the chlorine page.

## Connections
- Existing input producers:
  - rubber (polymerization);
  - steel and tungsten plates;
  - the fluid tank;
  - the lithium cell and advanced circuit (electronics);
  - plastic sheets (oil line);
  - oxygen (air separation unit, electrolytic cell, gas holder).
- Output consumer: the player. The scuba tank is a new consumer of oxygen.
- Technology connection: the charging station and capacity modules (shared `Chargeable` interface); Fabric fluid transfer for filling the tank.
- Magic connection: none.
- Required vs optional: all optional.

## Balance and automation
| Item | Cost to use | Full | Compare |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scuba tank | 1 mB oxygen a tick under water, only when air is short | 8,000 mB: 400 s | The air separation unit makes 2 mB/t at 64 JE/t: a tank is 200 s and 256,000 JE of it. Water breathing potions last 3 or 8 minutes. |
| Power katana | 1,000 JE a hit | 200,000 JE | Netherite sword: 8 damage, 1.6/s, 2,031 uses |
| Power bow | 500 JE a shot | 100,000 JE | Bow: 384 uses, needs arrows |

- Nothing turns oxygen, JE or plastic back into anything else, so there is no gain loop.
- Energy arrows cannot be picked up, so the bow cannot make arrows from JE.
- Plastic blocks: 8 sheets and a dye make 8 blocks. There is no recipe back to sheets.
- The katana's 11 damage is deliberately above netherite: it needs electronics (advanced circuit, lithium cell, tungsten) and costs JE every hit.

## Multiplayer and persistence
- Server-side: oxygen use, refilling, hits and shots all run on the server. The tank's oxygen is an item component (`jugcraft:oxygen`), and the weapons use the existing `jugcraft:energy` component.
- Free runners use vanilla attributes (`fall_damage_multiplier`, `step_height`), so the client and server agree on step height.
- Recipes follow the `machines` feature switch (scuba gear, free runners, weapons) and `crude_oil` (plastic blocks).

## Dependencies and assets
No new dependencies. Icons, bow draw frames, worn layers (scuba mask band, tank and straps; free-runner soles) and plastic textures are drawn by `tools/gear_textures.py` and `tools/plastic.py` from hand-made masks; nothing is traced or recoloured from vanilla or Mekanism.

## Verification
- `tools/check_mod_data.py` (340 IDs):
  - the gear extras registered in `JugcraftGear` match `tools/gear.py`;
  - the scuba tank's numbers match;
  - every icon, bow frame and worn layer exists;
  - the plastic blocks match `PetroBlocks.PLASTIC_COLORS`, with names, models, loot and recipes;
  - item definitions with nested models (the bow's draw) are checked all the way down.
- Game tests (CI):
  - `scubaTankKeepsAirUnderWater`: the air stays full under water and costs 1 mB; nothing happens without the mask.
  - `scubaTankFillsFromAGasHolder`: fills to 8,000 mB and leaves the rest in the holder.
  - `freeRunnersCancelFallDamage`: the attribute modifiers are present, alongside the armor.
  - `powerKatanaRunsOnCharge`: hits for 1 when empty; full damage and 1,000 JE when charged.
  - `powerBowFiresOnCharge`: one uncollectable arrow for 500 JE; an empty bow with no arrows fires nothing.
- Client screenshots: `jugcraft_scuba_gear_worn` and `jugcraft_plastic_blocks`.
- Not run:
  - client play;
  - two players;
  - an actual fall with free runners (the test checks the modifiers, not a landing);
  - fighting a mob with the katana or bow.

## World and event applicability
Not applicable: no worldgen, mobs or dimensions.

## Rollout and open questions
- Mekanism's MekaSuit, jetpack and flamethrower are not included. The rocket pack already covers the jetpack.
- Mekanism: Weapons' guns were not added. The grenade launcher (batch 18) is Jugcraft's ranged explosive.
- The katana's damage (11) and the bow's energy cost are first guesses for the owner to tune.
