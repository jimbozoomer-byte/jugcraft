# Fields and meadows (biomes batch 2)

Status: in progress on branch `claude/biomes`, with the region engine ([biome-regions.md](biome-regions.md)). Awaiting CI. **Not yet played.**
Proposal issue: none. The owner asked on 2 October 2026 to remake the Biomes O' Plenty catalog's biomes ([branches/BIOMES.md](../branches/BIOMES.md)), and then to carry on through every batch. Everything here is original: the catalog guided the concepts only.
Owner: @jimbozoomer-byte
Target milestone and tier: world generation and building (Discovery).
Primary specialty and supported player role: exploration, farming and building; open land for settling.

## Player experience
Nine open biomes grow in the **meadow** layout of Jugcraft regions (a quarter of them), each in place of the vanilla biome with the same climate:

| Biome | Replaces (meadow layout) | What grows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Field** | cool forest | flat land with teal grass, small spruces and clumps of oak bush, sunflowers and many flowers; foxes; villages |
| **Flower Meadow** | flower forest | no trees; vanilla flowers and wildflowers on almost every block |
| **Grassland** | cool plains (moister) | no trees; blue-green grass carpeted with clover |
| **Heathland** | savanna (moister) | brown-tinged grass, heather and wildflowers, pines and oak bushes; wild horses |
| **Lavender Field** | sunflower plains | lavender and tall lavender everywhere, jacarandas in bloom and oaks with bees |
| **Lush Grassland** | sparse jungle, warm plains | small jungle trees and oak bushes among orange cosmos and oxeye daisies; parrots; villages |
| **Prairie** | temperate plains (one weirdness half) | tall grass and goldenrod, oak bushes and the odd big oak; villages |
| **Shrubland** | temperate plains (the other half) | dense oak bushes and bushes, alliums, no trees; wild horses |
| **Steppe** | dry cool plains | tan, dry grass and dead bushes, nothing taller; horses, donkeys and llamas |

- Biomes O' Plenty's Forested Field and old Field merge into the Field, and its Thicket into the Shrubland.
- Seasons: all nine change grass and leaf colours with the seasons ([seasons.md](seasons.md)). Seven take winter snow when `seasons.snow` is on; the Heathland and Lush Grassland have mild winters and do not.
- **New plants** (each with an item; every small flower also has a potted form and makes dye):
  - Lavender (purple dye), and Tall Lavender, two blocks high (two purple dye).
  - Goldenrod (yellow dye), Heather (magenta dye) and Orange Cosmos (orange dye).
  - Clover: a flowerbed of up to four clumps, like pink petals; no dye.
- **New tree: the jacaranda**, a forked trunk under a wide, flat crown of violet blossom that flowers all year. It has a full wood set (grey bark, rosy planks) and drops saplings.
- Oak bushes (one oak log in a ball of oak leaves) dot the Field, Heathland, Prairie, Shrubland and Lush Grassland.

## Connections
- Input producer: world generation (Jugcraft regions, meadow layout).
- Output consumer: building (the jacaranda wood set), dyes (four new dye sources), bees and honey (every new plant is a bee flower and in `#minecraft:flowers`), suspicious stew (the small flowers), composting.
- Agriculture: the open, flat land and villages suit farms; the plains-based biomes keep vanilla's pumpkins, sugar cane and wild crops of their base.
- Technology connection: the sawmill saws jacaranda logs into 6 planks, and the tree farm grows jacaranda saplings, as for the other woods.
- Magic connection: none yet.
- Reachable entry path: a quarter of Jugcraft regions use the meadow layout, and each biome replaces a common vanilla one.
- Required vs optional: nothing here is required.

## Balance and automation
- Plants are vanilla flowers in behaviour: one dye per small flower, two per tall flower (vanilla's rates); bone meal on Tall Lavender drops a copy, as on a lilac. Compost chances follow vanilla's flowers (clover as low as grass).
- The jacaranda is ordinary wood: 4 planks per log by hand, 6 in the sawmill. No new conversions, no loops.

## Multiplayer and persistence
- Server authority: world generation is the server's.
- `biomes.enabled=false` stops the biomes in new chunks and the new hand recipes (dyes, jacaranda wood). Every block, item and biome stays registered.
- Existing worlds: new chunks only; see [biome-regions.md](biome-regions.md).

## Dependencies and assets
- Plants are registered alike from the generated `/jugcraft/plants.json` (`tools/plants.py`, `JugcraftAgriculture.registerWildPlants`): vanilla's FlowerBlock and TallFlowerBlock, and `GroundCoverBlock` (ground cover that works like pink petals), with vanilla properties. Models use vanilla's cross, potted-cross and flowerbed shapes by reference.
- Textures drawn by code in `tools/wild_textures.py`; nothing read, traced or recoloured.
- Biomes start from vanilla bases by reference (`tools/biome_bases.py`) and add their own plants (`tools/biomes.py` EXTRAS). No Mojang file is copied.

## Verification
Results are recorded under "Results" below after CI runs.
- `python3 tools/check_mod_data.py`: every plant has its blockstate, models, item, name, loot and tags; the rules do not overlap; every tree feature and placed feature a biome names exists.
- Server game tests (`BiomeGameTests`):
  - `wildPlantsWork`: each small flower is a flower that stands on grass, with a potted form and an item; Tall Lavender takes two blocks and drops one; a clover patch of four drops four.
  - `jacarandaSaplingsGrow`: a sapling grows a jacaranda (sizes logged).
  - `regionLayoutFollowsItsRules`: every batch 2 rule places its biome in the meadow layout.
- Client game test (`BiomeClientGameTests`): distances from the start of a real world (seed `jugcraft`) to each biome, and screenshots of all nine from above.
- Not run: play, a dedicated server, two clients.

### Results
Not yet run in CI.

## World and event applicability
- Biome fit: each biome takes the climate of the vanilla biome it replaces, so it borders what that biome bordered.
- Seasons: see above.
