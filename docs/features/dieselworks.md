# Dieselworks building blocks (batch 45)

Status: implemented (pending CI and review)
Proposal issue: none; the owner chose it in chat ("start the building blocks batch") from the dieselpunk ideas list.
Owner: jimbozoomer-byte
Target milestone and tier: steel tier (needs iron, copper and steel plates)
Primary specialty and supported player role: building and decoration

## Player experience
Blocks in the look of the batch 44 dieselpunk giants, so a factory can be built to match its machines:

| Block | Variants | Recipe (makes) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weathered Steel Plate (`rust_plate`) | slab, stairs | 4 iron plates (4) |
| Riveted Steel Plate (`riveted_rust_plate`) | slab, stairs | 4 weathered steel plate + iron nugget (4) |
| Patina Plate | slab, stairs | 4 copper plates (4) |
| Perforated Patina Plate | | 4 patina plate + iron nugget (4) |
| Red Iron Plate | slab, stairs | 8 weathered steel plate + red dye (8) |
| Copper Dome Plate | slab, stairs | 4 patina plate + copper ingot (4) |
| Riveted Band | | 4 weathered steel plate + 4 iron nuggets (4) |
| Skid Iron | | 4 steel plates (4) |
| Ribbed Patina Pillar / Ribbed Steel Pillar (`ribbed_rust_pillar`) | placed along an axis | 2 patina / weathered steel plate (2) |
| Steel Grating (`rust_grating`, see-through) | slab | 4 iron bars (4) |
| Steel I-Beam (placed along an axis) | | 7 steel plates (6) |
| Porthole Window | | 4 weathered steel plate + glass (4) |
| Amber Cage Lamp (light 14) | | 7 iron nuggets + glowstone + weathered steel plate (2) |

Slabs make 6 from 3 and stairs 4 from 6, as in vanilla.

## Connections
- Existing input producer: the plates from the metal press, iron bars, glass, glowstone and dye.
- Existing output consumer: building only.
- Technology/magic connection: none; this is decoration. The patina, red iron, copper dome and skid blocks reuse the giants' textures (`dr_*`). The steel set has its own `dw_*` textures (see below); the porthole texture is drawn here too.

## The steel set's textures (5 October 2026)
The owner called the steel plate blocks horrific ("like you didn't even try") and pointed to bastion concrete as the look they like. The two steel plates had reused the giants' machine textures: warm brown-grey, framed in a near-black outline on all four sides (so a wall became a grid of dark-mortared tiles), with a rust stain and pip-like bolts stamped on every block. The whole steel set now has its own textures in one cool blue-grey steel palette (`tools/dieselworks.STEEL`), drawn by the rules in [ART_DIRECTION.md](../ART_DIRECTION.md#tiling-building-blocks):

| Block | Texture | Look |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weathered Steel Plate, slab, stairs | `dw_steel_plate` | One brushed sheet a block: the seam split across the edge (lit top and left, seam bottom and right), brushed streaks one shade up |
| Riveted Steel Plate, slab, stairs | `dw_steel_plate_riveted` | The same sheet framed by twelve rivets four pixels apart, so the rivet rows carry on evenly across every joint; none crosses the slab cut |
| Ribbed Steel Pillar | `dw_ribbed_steel` (side), `dw_steel_plate` (end) | A rib every four rows, shaded across like a round column |
| Riveted Band | `dw_steel_band` | A dark strap with a rivet every four pixels, unbroken across the block edge |
| Steel Grating, slab | `dw_grating` | A lit steel frame and bars with nine even see-through holes |

No colour is random per pixel, and there is no rust. The blocks show as metal on maps (they were brown). The giants, the zeppelin and the vehicles keep their own `dr_*` steel; the porthole ring stays on it too, since its texture is shared with the zeppelin and the raiders. Block IDs, recipes and models are unchanged, so placed blocks just look new.

## Balance and automation
One plate of metal makes one block. No recipe turns a block back into metal, so nothing gains material.

## Multiplayer and persistence
Ordinary blocks with no block entities and nothing that ticks. All are mined with a pickaxe and drop themselves; a double slab drops two.

## Dependencies and assets
No dependencies. Code: `building/Dieselworks.java`. Data and art: `tools/dieselworks.py`. All art is original.

## Verification
- Planned in CI: the game test `dieselworksBlocksPlace`. It places all 25 blocks and checks that the grating is see-through, the I-beam is not a full cube and the lamp gives light 14.
- Planned in CI: the client screenshot `jugcraft_dieselworks`, a riveted wall with portholes, a grating catwalk on I-beams and lamps, ribbed steel pillars, a riveted band and a weathered steel floor; since 5 October 2026 the front row also holds the steel plates' slabs and stairs.
- Done offline for the 5 October 2026 textures: 3 x 3 tilings, a block-model render of the screenshot scene before and after, and a palette and noise check (four to six colours each, no small random steps, no all-round dark outline). Not yet seen in the game.
- Done locally: `check_mod_data.py` and `check_repository.py` pass, and offline renders of the block models were reviewed.
- Not done: a survival play-test.

## World and event applicability
Not applicable: the blocks are crafted and placed by players only.

## Rollout and open questions
- More shapes could follow if the owner wants them: walls, panes, ladders and doors in these materials.
