# Jugcraft TODO list

This list tracks concrete owner-requested follow-ups. An unchecked task is planned work, not implemented gameplay. See the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for the wider delivery direction and [existing-content map](WHAT_EXISTS.md) for current source. Feature details and dependencies belong in their linked briefs.

## Jugcraft Encyclopedia

Owner-requested 6 October 2026. Independent feature brief: [Jugcraft Encyclopedia](features/jugcraft-encyclopedia.md). All ten supplied screenshots are included in the [reference gallery](#reference-gallery) below and archived in the [reference folder](images/jugcraft-encyclopedia/README.md).

- [ ] **Build the full Jugcraft Encyclopedia UI**, covering technology, magic, detailed pathways and integrated quests.
- [ ] Add an inventory entry button and a configurable keybind. Both open the same Encyclopedia without crafting, carrying or using an Encyclopedia item.
- [ ] Provide a home view explaining the overall machinery/technology route and the overall magic route.
- [ ] Add chapter/specialty navigation and in-depth pages for each pathway within both routes, including useful products, entry requirements, process steps and optional branches.
- [ ] Explain the essential technology path and the substantial pre-electric workshop's sideways possibilities. Show steel and electricity as parallel capabilities under the owner's planning direction.
- [ ] Cover technology specialties such as ceramics/construction, mechanical power, metals, electricity, logistics, industrial agriculture, mineral separation, chemical refining, recovery/pollution and later precision/expedition systems as those features become available.
- [ ] Give magic its own overview and detailed school/ritual/spell/apparatus/reagent pathways, with useful crafting, cultivation, exploration and combat applications.
- [ ] Design route graphs with readable connections, grouped nodes and prominent milestones. Distinguish actual required materials/capabilities from recommendations, trade alternatives and suggested quest order.
- [ ] Provide detailed machine/material/spell/ritual entries and recipe/process links using canonical game data; clearly label planned versus implemented content.
- [ ] Include quests linked to their pathway explanations, with objectives and visible progress/completion. Keep the guide useful without requiring every player to complete every branch.
- [ ] Decide quest objective types, detection/consumption rules, reward policy, spoiler rules and individual/shared-party progress before implementing those behaviors.
- [ ] Implement authoritative quest completion and any approved rewards with stable identifiers, persistence and duplicate-claim prevention.
- [ ] Design search, navigation/history, accessibility and readable states across supported GUI scales; consider optional bookmarks and pinned goals.
- [ ] Decide compatibility for the existing Engineer's Handbook while preserving saved registrations. The new Encyclopedia itself is not an item.
- [ ] Build an original Jugcraft visual presentation informed by the ten references, without importing their depicted artwork or requiring an external quest mod by assumption.
- [ ] Verify both entry points, route/content accuracy, GUI behavior, bounded performance, and relevant two-client/restart/reconnect/quest persistence behavior.

Exact visuals, default key, quests/rewards and release order remain to design. The feature is broader than the industrial plan: it must independently explain magic and the deeper pathways in both routes.

## Progression and balance

- [ ] Tune the minimum fresh-world route to first electricity toward **2–4 active hours when following known recipes**, excluding optional building detours. This is an approximate playtest target, not a timed gate or a measured result.
- [ ] Map the reachable essential ceramics/mechanical workshop/electrical component route and its bootstrap requirements, with parallel steel progression.
- [ ] Place substantial construction, agricultural, mineral and recovery choices beside the essential route; do not require completing every specialty before moving to another capability.
- [ ] Validate the route in representative solo and trade scenarios, then adjust material quantities, processing time and power costs from actual playtest evidence.

Related owner planning records: [industrial agriculture, PR #208](https://github.com/jimbozoomer-byte/jugcraft/pull/208), [mineral sands/refining, PR #209](https://github.com/jimbozoomer-byte/jugcraft/pull/209), and [waste/recycling/pollution, PR #210](https://github.com/jimbozoomer-byte/jugcraft/pull/210). These are planning work, not claims that those proposed systems are implemented.

## Industrial chemistry, gas fuels and advanced materials

Owner-requested 7 October 2026. Independent planning brief: [industrial chemistry and fuels](features/industrial-chemistry-and-fuels-plan.md). These follow-ups are planning work, not implemented recipes or tested balance.

- [ ] Map a reachable **steel-built electrical chemistry entry**, preserving the earlier workshop/first-electricity route and prioritizing gas processing, aluminum and titanium.
- [ ] Extend existing electrolysis/generator systems for directly usable hydrogen and catalytic methane, with complete electricity, compression, heat, separation and generation budgets that prevent closed positive-power loops.
- [ ] Define distinct CO2 + 4 H2 and CO + 3 H2 methanation recipes, reusable catalyst capability, nickel entry, optional later ruthenium improvement, readable heat/pressure requirements and recovered water.
- [ ] Add an earlier steel-era coal gasifier with an accounted CO-bearing output, cleanup and substantial numeric pollution; keep CO separate from digester CO2.
- [ ] Design advanced organic-waste/food digesters using the selected 60/40 methane/CO2 game mixture, usable digestate and hydrogen upgrading into separated pure methane.
- [ ] Develop milling/mashing -> fermentation -> distillation -> dehydration for crop bioethanol, a modest earlier bio-generator role and later brewery CO2 collection/cleanup, preserving existing bioethanol IDs and consumers.
- [ ] Add optional CO2 capture/release to industrial carbonate cement processing and optional Coke Oven gas/condensate recovery with explicit material, energy and full-storage accounting.
- [ ] Verify filled gas tanks retain exact content through break, pickup and placement and reconnect through shared pipes; cover joined-tank partitioning, simultaneous transfers and multiplayer pickup.
- [ ] Detail H2/chlorine -> HCl and useful carbon-bearing monomer/polymer connections, while retaining existing PVC, butadiene rubber and natural-rubber routes.
- [ ] Expand process-specific reagents, useful rigid/flexible/protective/heat-resistant polymers and advanced ceramic linings/insulators/cutting/precision parts. Limit purity grades to meaningful consumers; prioritize refining/electronics over broad new everyday finishes.
- [ ] Develop mainly larger/better general-purpose batteries with a limited set of useful specialty choices.
- [ ] Document actual machine roles, recipes, consumer links and optional paths in the Encyclopedia; audit reachability, gas/element units, energy loops, pollution, bounded factory work and persistence before gameplay delivery.

## Reference gallery

All ten original owner-attached UI screenshots are preserved unchanged. They are documentation/design references, not Jugcraft runtime textures. Descriptions and individual file links are in the [independent feature brief](features/jugcraft-encyclopedia.md#visual-references-and-provenance); provenance and integrity metadata are in [the manifest](images/jugcraft-encyclopedia/reference-manifest.json).
