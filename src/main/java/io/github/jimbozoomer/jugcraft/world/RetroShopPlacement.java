/**
 * One Retro Game Shop in every new village. A village is built by the game's jigsaw placer, which fills each house
 * slot from a shuffled list of the houses pool. While a village has no shop yet, the shop goes to the front of that
 * list, so the first house slot it fits becomes the shop; once it is placed it leaves the list, so there is never a
 * second.
 *
 * <p>Village houses are built inside their street's own plot (the game's "expansion hack" for villages), and many
 * plots are too small for the 9 by 8 shop: in a desert village only 12 of the 38 house slots can hold it, and none of
 * them is at a meeting point. So now and then a village is laid out with no slot that has room. When the placer
 * finishes with the shop offered but not placed, the village is laid out again from its start piece
 * ({@link #relayout}), up to {@link #LAYOUTS} layouts in all. The new layout draws on the same seeded random source, so
 * a world seed still makes the same village.
 *
 * <p>State is per thread: a whole structure is laid out on one thread, inside JigsawPlacement's private
 * {@code addPieces} ({@code mixin/JigsawPlacementMixin} calls {@link #beginStructure}, {@link #relayout} after each
 * layout and {@link #endStructure}). The placer creates a piece for everything it places
 * ({@code mixin/PoolElementStructurePieceMixin} calls {@link #placed}). Outside a village, or with the
 * {@code retro_trader} switch off, nothing changes.
