/**
 * Leaves of a deciduous tree (the larch, maple and aspen) that follow the seasons. They follow the server's season
 * day ({@link JugcraftSeasons#today()}) on their tree's {@link Schedule}: green, then their autumn colour
 * ({@link Foliage#GOLD}; the maple's models show reds, oranges and golds), then bare twigs until spring. Each block
 * turns up to {@link #JITTER} days early or late, fixed by its position, so a crown turns gradually and neighbouring
 * trees differ. Leaves catch up on their random ticks; one that changes also brings the leaves it touches up to date
 * (up to {@link #SPREAD} of them, in loaded chunks), so a tree generated green in autumn turns together within moments
 * of its first tick. Leaves placed by a player or grown from a sapling start in today's state; with seasons off they
 * stay green. Only the look changes: otherwise these are vanilla leaves (natural ones decay away from logs; they drop
 * saplings and sticks).
