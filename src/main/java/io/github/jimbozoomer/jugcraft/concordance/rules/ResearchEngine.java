/**
 * Applies evidence to a player's {@link Knowledge} under a set of {@link ConcordanceRules}. Pure and deterministic: the
 * same knowledge, rules and evidence always give the same result, and the server is the only caller.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Evidence is recorded only for entries whose prerequisites are met and which have a state left to reach, and only
 * where it matches one of the rules for such a state.</li>
 * <li>Each evidence key counts once. Repeating an observation adds nothing (an examination in less light than before
 * improves the stored light level, which is the only way a repeat changes anything).</li>
 * <li>States are reached in order; one piece of evidence can carry an entry through several states at once (examining a
 * specimen in darkness first time both encounters and observes it).</li>
 * </ul>
