 * A player's Focus: the points they hold, and the game time from which the next points are counted. Focus returns one
 * point every {@value #REGEN_TICKS} ticks up to {@value #MAX}, worked out from the game time whenever it is read, so no
 * player ticks to regenerate it and the server and client agree without a packet every tick. The game time only ever
 * moves forward (changing the time of day does not touch it), so turning the clock cannot refill anyone.
 * <p>
 * Immutable; {@link #spend} returns the new pool, or null when there is not enough, so a failed spend changes nothing.
 * Keep the two numbers equal to FOCUS_MAX and FOCUS_REGEN_TICKS in tools/concordance.py.
