/**
 * Guns in the hands of mobs (slice 10F, docs/features/guns.md): the raider gunners (raiders/RaiderInfantry) carry the
 * service arms ({@link #ARMS}) and fire them with the guns' own numbers, through the players' bullet code
 * ({@link GunShots#bullets}). Keep the numbers in sync with tools/guns.py; tools/check_mod_data.py checks them.
 * <ul>
 * <li>A shot does {@value #DAMAGE} of the gun's damage a pellet. The bullet damage type scales with the game's
 * difficulty against players, as a monster's attack does.</li>
 * <li>A gunner closes on its target until it can see it from within its gun's reach, then fires in bursts: an automatic
 * gun {@value #BURST} shots at its interval, any other one shot, then it waits {@value #PAUSE} ticks. Each shot goes from
 * its eye at the middle of its target, strayed by the gun's spread from the hip.</li>
 * <li>It counts its magazine and, when it is empty, reloads for the gun's own reload time. It needs no rounds, so the
 * gun in its hand stays empty: one that drops (a chance of {@value #DROP}, more with Looting) holds none.</li>
 * <li>Its bullets pass through its own side ({@link Gunner#spares}), marker stands and what it rides.</li>
 * <li>The clients that see it play the shot and the reload on its gun, as they do another player's
 * ({@link GunActionPayload}).</li>
 * </ul>
