"""JSON resources for the graveyard pack, from tools/graveyard.py: every headstone's models (one per block of it and
stage of weathering), blockstates, item models, words, loot (the epitaph goes with the item), recipes and tags.

Called from agriculture_data.py. Formats follow vanilla Minecraft 26.3's own files: blockstate variants, block models,
loot with copy_components from the block entity, stonecutting and shaped recipes. A memorial taller or longer than one
block is cut into one model per block: unturned boxes are cut at the block's edges (only along the way it is tall or
long, so arms and finials may reach out over the blocks beside it), turned boxes go whole to the block their middle is
in. Faces reaching outside a block's texture square are given UVs inside it (decor3_data.fitted).
