"""Arms motion (batch 43, docs/features/arms-motion.md): keyframed attack, hold and guard animations for the arms of
batch 42, written to assets/jugcraft/arms_motion/<kind>.json and played on the client by client/arms/ArmsMotion.java.

Learned from the combat animation mods the owner sent (Better Combat, Malfu Combat Animation, Player Animation Library,
Fresh Moves; studied for their approach only, nothing of theirs is used):
- an animation is a few keyframes per bone, eased, not a frame per tick: smoothness comes from interpolation;
- every strike has anticipation (a short cock-back), the blow, then follow-through and a settle, and the whole body
  joins in: the torso twists, the head counter-turns, the feet step;
- two-handed arms are held in a guard with the off hand on the grip or haft;
- motion is layered: the keyframed pose on top, the walk cycle kept underneath on the legs.

What is done differently here, for fluid motion that stays cheap:
- keys are joined by cubic Hermite splines with Catmull-Rom tangents, so speed carries through a key instead of stopping
  at every key as ease-in-out does; a key's tension (0 to 1) flattens its tangent for a crisp stop where one is wanted;
- the torso bends at the waist (the model's body turns about its neck, so the neck and shoulders are moved to make the
  hinge), and the arms ride on the torso, their rotation composed with it;
- the clock is vanilla's own attack swing, read with the partial tick, so it is smooth at any frame rate and needs no
  networking: other players' swings already reach every client;
- clips are parsed once into flat float arrays and evaluated with no allocation; far players get the arms only.

Units: rotations in degrees, offsets in model pixels. Model space is Minecraft's: y down, the front is -z, the right
arm at -x. An arm's rx below 0 raises it forwards; a right arm's rz above 0 lifts it out to the side; ry above 0 swings
a raised arm, or turns the body, to the right.
