"""Industrial machine forms the game registers (docs/features/industrial-machine-foundation.md), starting with the
starter factory's Electrolytic Separator (docs/features/industrial-electrolytic-separator.md, package 2 of the
owner's factory plan).

Each form is described here for its art, recipes and data, and in IndustrialForms.java for the game;
tools/check_mod_data.py checks that the two agree. Layers are given bottom first, each as rows from the front to the
back, each row's characters from the viewer's left to right, standing in front of the machine: C the controller,
# another structural block, ~ clearance for a moving part and . open access space.

Models are authored in structure space like tools/large_machines.py: pixels, facing north with the front at z = 0,
the controller's block at 0..16 on every axis and the viewer's right towards -x. model_writer.split_model slices
them into one model per part, in the form's part order: the controller first, then every other structural block
from the bottom layer up, the front row first, left to right (MachineForm in Java).
