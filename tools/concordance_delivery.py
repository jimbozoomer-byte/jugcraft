"""The Arcane Concordance's library integration matrix (roadmap step 32): docs/features/arcane-concordance-delivery.md.

One row for every library in distribution/frameworks.lock.json. A row covers what the Concordance actually does with
the library, what happens without it, the game tests that exercise it, and what is still limited. The version, side and
whether Jugcraft needs it come from the lock, never from here. The build (build.gradle) declares every library the lock
marks as required in fabric.mod.json's `depends`, so Fabric Loader refuses to start Jugcraft without one, and every
optional one in `suggests`.

Nothing here is generated into the game. tools/check_mod_data.py (check_delivery) checks that:

- every library in the lock has exactly one row, and every row names a library in the lock;
- every game test a row names exists (a method, or a whole client test class);
- a library whose row says it is not used really is not referred to from Jugcraft's code;
- the record's matrix is the one table() renders.

Run it to print the matrix: python3 tools/concordance_delivery.py
