"""Big guns (batch 51, docs/features/big-guns.md): heavy artillery for the dieselpunk front.

- The Siege Mortar: a fixed emplacement on a concrete ring, a railed turntable deck, a yellow cradle and a fat black
  barrel that lobs Heavy Shells in a high arc.
- The Self-Propelled Howitzer: a tracked gun carriage with an armoured cab and a long-barrelled gun with a muzzle brake
  that fires Heavy Shells flat or high.
- The Flak Gun: twin autocannon on a cross mount whose Flak Shells burst next to anything flying.
- The Observation Balloon: a tethered kite balloon whose basket rises high above its anchor while someone rides it, so
  a spotter with a Range Finder can mark targets far away for the guns.

Every shell bursts in a Blast (weapons/Blast): it hurts living things and never breaks a block. The guns aim
themselves at a target marked with a Range Finder (the gunner's own mark, else the nearest spotter's) and work out the
elevation that lands the shell on it; without a mark they fire where the gunner looks.

Java: artillery/ (the entities, shells, items and JugcraftArtillery); client/ArtilleryRenderers draws the parts
exported here (assets/jugcraft/artillery_quads.json). tools/check_mod_data.py keeps the numbers the same.
