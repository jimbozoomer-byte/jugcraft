"""Roadmap step 22: sympathetic links, curses, wards and dream travel (docs/features/arcane-concordance-hexes.md).

Sympathy (the Hexweavers). A taglock touched to a creature holds a link to it: strength 100, fading one point every
DECAY_TICKS, never to oneself, never to a player the multiplayer rules forbid harming, never through a linking ward.
Held with a curse's reagent, it casts that curse through the link once every rule allows (Java: hex/Hexes.java):
the link alive and strong enough, the target found in the caster's dimension within MAX_RANGE blocks, the rules
letting the caster harm it, no curse ward, Focus enough. A curse pulses a bounded status through the shared effect
boundary, revalidated at every pulse, and is lifted by its remedy, by its time, or when the rules stop allowing it.
A scrying glass investigates: first a curse's name and remedy, then its caster (unless a scrying ward hides them).
Ward sigils ward their user against one category of operation (linking, cursing, scrying, moving) for twenty
minutes; anyone may use them, and the scrying glass, without research.

Dreams (the Dreamwalkers). At an Oneiric Censer at night, everything a dreamer carries goes into one escrow on them;
they dream in adventure mode within RADIUS blocks of their body and catch dream wisps (three at once, one more every
WISP_TICKS); however the dream ends, the escrow comes back slot by slot, with their place and game mode, never more
experience than they entered with (spent experience stays spent), and the dreamglass the rules allow (Java:
dream/DreamRules.java, dreaming/Dreaming.java). Dreamglass makes ward sigils.

The definitions are data (data/jugcraft/concordance/curse, read by Java's concordance/hex). tools/concordance.py merges
these tables into its own; tools/check_mod_data.py checks the numbers the Java repeats.
