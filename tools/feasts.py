Pies. The owner chose (7 October 2026) to give the apple pie their own art, and to let vanilla's pumpkin pie be set down
as their pumpkin pie. Two more pies in their art join the Hearth Oven's: chocolate and the sweet berry cheesecake (their
fillings are in tools/agriculture.py PIES, marked "owner"). A pie in the owner's art wears their top and filling, a
shared crust side and bottom, their slice, and their whole-pie icon as its item.

A placed pie (PLACED_PIES) is a vanilla food item set down as a pie: sneak and use it on a block. It is eaten or cut
`slices` slices at a time like any pie; its slices add up to the whole item exactly, so setting it down is never a gain.
