"""Material painters in the manner of the vanilla block textures, so Jugcraft's blocks sit beside the world's own
without standing out (docs/ART_DIRECTION.md, "Texturing: keep it clean"; the owner's 5 October 2026 note that stone
should look like stone, cobblestone or stone bricks, not flat grey and not salt-and-pepper noise).

What the vanilla textures do, and what these painters copy in manner only (no Mojang texture is read, traced or
recoloured; every pixel here comes from code):
- **A short palette, mostly mid-tones.** Five or six tones per material; most pixels are the middle two, the darkest and
  lightest are rare accents.
- **Clumped variation, not per-pixel noise.** Tones come in small patches two to four pixels across (smooth value noise
  at two scales, snapped to the palette), so a face reads as a surface with a little grain, never as static.
- **Shape from light.** Stones, bricks and boards are lit along their top and left edges and shaded along their
  bottom and right, with dark joints between them.
- **Everything tiles.** Every pattern repeats every `size` pixels, so neighbouring blocks join up seamlessly.

Painters take a seed and return a function that paints a `Px` (tools/flora_art.py) or a Canvas-like object with
`px(x, y, colour)`; `img(painter, size)` makes an image directly.
