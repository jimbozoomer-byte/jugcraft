"""Roadmap step 24: the complete progression graph (docs/features/arcane-concordance-progression.md).

The Concordance's five stages (Initiate, Practitioner, Adept, Master, Architect) are data
(data/jugcraft/concordance/stage), each reached by any one of its ROUTES once the stage before it is. The canonical
progression graph is not written beside the rules: Java's progression/ProgressionGraph builds it from them (research
and its evidence, invocations, rituals, the practice gates here, the Conclave's ranks, the stages), and so does audit()
below, independently, over the generator's own tables. Both answer the same questions: can one player alone reach every
research state and every stage from a fresh world; does any step need something only a later stage provides; does a
cycle block anything; does each middle stage have at least two routes of its own.

What the graph leaves to things at hand (specimens, stations, offerings, the devices a practice needs) is checked by
availability(): every specimen tag holds something craftable or renewable, every station, offering and device can be
made from obtainable things (the generated recipes, recursively), and every vanilla item a required step needs is in
VANILLA_SOURCES with how it is obtained and, for finite world materials, a recovery route.
