"""JSON resources for the Farmhouse Kitchen (agriculture slice 9), from tools/kitchen.py: the Kitchen Stove (a brick range,
its firebox and grill aglow when lit), the Skillet (an iron pan with a wooden handle), the Cutting Board, the eleven
kitchen cabinets (doors open while anyone is in one), the knives, and the cutting recipes. Every texture is the owner's
own, imported from the shared library by tools/owner_art.py. The foods' item models, names and tags come from
tools/agriculture.py ITEMS like every other food's; their cooking recipes from its COOKING table; the crafting from SHAPED.

Called from agriculture_data.py (assets, loot, recipes, tags). Formats follow vanilla Minecraft 26.3's own files
(the smithing_transform recipe is shaped like vanilla's netherite tool upgrades).
