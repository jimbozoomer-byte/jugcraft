"""Orchards (the sixth slice of the kitchen and cooking expansion in docs/branches/AGRICULTURE.md): pear, peach, lemon and
orange trees, which fruit every year without being cut down, as the apple tree does (tools/agriculture.py CIDER), and what
is made of their fruit: two juices, two pies and three preserves. The owner chose (7 October 2026) to build this slice in
Jugcraft's own art, the owner's library having no fruit trees ("Slice 6, Jugcraft art"), and to plant these four trees
of the roster (no grapes, hops or berries yet). Every texture is drawn by tools/orchard_textures.py. The numbers here are
what agriculture/OrchardTree, OrchardLeavesBlock and JugcraftAgriculture use; tools/check_mod_data.py compares them.
tools/orchard_data.py writes the JSON.

A tree grows from its seed (a pear's seeds, a peach's pit) planted as a sapling, into a tree of vanilla oak logs with a
crown of its own leaves. Leaves the tree grew itself, with air below them, blossom (fruit 1) and then hang with ripe fruit
(fruit 2), a stage in FRUIT_CHANCE random ticks each, about a Minecraft day in all; a right-click picks the ripe fruit,
which drops below, and the leaves start again. Broken, the leaves drop as the apple's do: now and then a seed, sticks, and
the ripe fruit. A fruit crafts into its seed, so a single fruit found or traded starts an orchard.

The trees grow wild: in the Orchard (pears and peaches), the Mediterranean Forest and the Subtropics (lemons and oranges),
among the trees those biomes already have (tools/biomes.py), and, outside Jugcraft's biomes, in the vanilla biomes each
tree's `biomes` tags name (a patch like the apple tree's, one tree in `rarity` chunks).

Balance (docs/BALANCE.md, tools/menu.py COOK_BONUS): a fruit gives what an apple gives (the lemon, too sour to eat whole,
half). A juice gives at most COOK_BONUS more than its fruit; a pie's four slices and a jar's four servings stay within
COOK_BONUS of what went into them (tools/check_mod_data.py checks every dish, pie and preserve).
