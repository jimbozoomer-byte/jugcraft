"""The biomes branch (docs/branches/BIOMES.md): Jugcraft regions and the biomes in them.

Jugcraft regions (biome/JugcraftRegions, docs/features/biome-regions.md): the Overworld is divided into irregular
cells about REGIONS["size"] blocks across, and REGIONS["share"] of them are Jugcraft regions, each in one of LAYOUTS
layouts: vanilla's climate table with that layout's RULES applied (a vanilla biome, in the given climate bands, becomes
a Jugcraft biome). The rest stay vanilla. Every Jugcraft biome is also listed in vanilla's table at a climate no place
has, so world generation knows it. RULES are written to /jugcraft/region_rules.json, which Java reads.

Biomes are built from the vanilla biome they replace (biome_bases.BASES): its ores, caves, lakes and springs, with
their own trees and plants (trees.SHAPES). Batch 1 is the seasonal forests.
