"""Choose which client game test classes a change needs, and share them out between CI's client jobs.

The client game tests start a real game and photograph showrooms, which takes each of CI's three client jobs 20 to 30
minutes when every class runs. Most pull requests change a few blocks, so a pull request runs only the classes that
show what it changed; main and a manual run of the Build workflow run them all (docs/TESTING.md).

How a changed file picks classes (src/gametest/resources/fabric.mod.json lists the classes):
- a client test class itself, or one newly listed: that class;
- docs, Markdown, the generators and checks in tools/ and scripts/ (their output is committed and judged below),
  the art sources in art/ (what the game loads is copied into the assets and judged there), data under
  src/main/resources/data, the language file, the optional resource packs no client test turns on, unit tests,
  server-only game tests and Claude's settings: nothing;
- a Java class under src/main or src/client that only gained code (a feature registering itself in a registry, one
  more entry in a list): the classes matching the names and IDs it gained; comments do not count;
- a Java class whose existing code changed: every class that shows it (names it, or whose IDs match it with "Block",
  "Renderer" and similar endings taken off: "GiantBeatingHeartRenderer" -> giant_beating_heart) or shows a Jugcraft
  class that uses it ("CrewedGun" -> the classes showing the Siege Mortar, Flak Gun and tower guns); a class no test
  shows picks nothing, as the mod job's server game tests still run;
- a Java class that a quarter of the classes or more show (a registry such as JugcraftAgriculture or Jugcraft, which
  most tests use to reach their blocks): the classes matching the names and IDs on the lines it lost or gained, as
  for a class only gaining code, since what changed is what those lines name;
- a model, blockstate, texture or other asset: every class naming its ID, or an ID it starts with
  ("ready_rack_0" -> ready_rack);
- anything else (build files, the workflow, mixins, the test mod's helpers): every class.

A test "names" an ID when its source has it as a string ("pipe_organ", "jugcraft:pipe_organ") or a constant
(PIPE_ORGAN), or when a Jugcraft class it uses that few tests use (a feature's own list, not a shared registry) has it.

Usage: select_client_tests.py [--base REV] [--head REV] [--all] [--shards N] [--github-output FILE]
Without --base, or with --all, every class runs. Prints a summary and one line per shard.
