"""Ember, the Hearthbinders' Principle (docs/features/arcane-concordance-ember.md), part 1: research and invocations.

The Hearthbinders keep fire and use it with control: heat for hearths, kilns and forges, never wildfire. Part 1 is
their research entry, Hearthbinding, and four invocations written in the shared grammar (roadmap step 10's rules):

- Hearthspark (utility): kindles an unlit campfire, candle or candle cake where you look, as flint and steel would;
- Hearthguard (defense): Fire Resistance;
- Cinderbolt (damage): fire damage that grows with fire Spell Power, and Smoulder;
- Hearthflare (damage, once mastered): a burst of fire round you, and Smoulder.

What Ember adds to the shared effects is small (Java: concordance/ember): an alteration in Ember's Spell Power school
kindles a hearth instead of putting out fire, and the Smoulder status keeps a creature alight while it lasts (vanilla
burning: water, rain, Fire Resistance and fire immunity all answer it). Nothing here places fire in the world.

Part 2 (docs/features/arcane-concordance-ember-regalia.md) is the Hearthbinder's regalia, made from the owner's own fire
art (art/owner-library/originals/Magic, imported as supplied by tools/owner_art.py from OWNER_FILES below): the Lesser
Focus of Fire and the Focus of Fire (fire Spell Power, worn in a Spell Focus slot), the Fire Bangle (a Hearthbinder's
melee blows leave the creature smouldering; worn in a Bracelet slot), and the Pyromancer's Hat, Robes, Leggings and Boots
(leather's protection and half a point of fire Spell Power each, worn as the owner's GeckoLib model). The two Trinkets
slots are the owner's own (their Curios data and slot icons, ported). Hearthflare's release is the owner's "pyro"
recordings. Java: concordance/ember/EmberGear.java and the client's EmberClient.

tools/concordance.py merges these tables into its own. Numbers the Java repeats are checked by tools/check_mod_data.py.
