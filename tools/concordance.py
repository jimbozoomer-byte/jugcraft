"""The Arcane Concordance: Jugcraft's magic system (docs/ARCANE_CONCORDANCE.md). This module is the canonical source for
its vocabulary, numbers and first content (docs/features/arcane-concordance-first-light.md, milestone 1, "First Light").

Everything the game and the codex say about the Concordance is generated from the tables here, so a number cannot
differ between the research rules, the spell, the bench, the codex pages, the recipe viewer and the tests:

- data/jugcraft/concordance/{research,invocation,working,conversion,component,instrument}/*.json: the server-owned
  rules, read by concordance/ConcordanceData.java (a data pack can override them; the server validates them on every
  reload); components and instruments are the composition grammar (roadmap step 8, concordance/compose);
- data/jugcraft/spell/*.json: the Spell Engine spells the invocations cast, and the carrier for inscribed spells
  (tools/check_mod_data.py lints them);
- data/jugcraft/modonomicon/...: the codex (a Modonomicon book) and the research bridge that shows its pages
  (Jugcraft awards an advancement on the server; Modonomicon turns it into a research fact; the fact unlocks pages);
- data/jugcraft/spell_assignments/*.json: Spell Engine opt-outs for Jugcraft arms that have their own weapon arts;
- assets/jugcraft/player_animations, dynamiclights, lang, models, items: presentation;
- assets/jugcraft/recipe_view.json "concordance": the bench's workings for JEI.

Java mirrors a few constants (Focus, motes, the lantern); tools/check_mod_data.py check_concordance() keeps them equal.

The ten Principles, seven resources, sixteen traditions and five stages below are NEW PROPOSALS made for this system on
5 October 2026. Nothing earlier in Jugcraft defined them; they extend (and do not rename) the eight school seeds in
docs/CONTENT_BRANCHES.md. Their ids become stable once released.
