"""Rocketry, batch 38 (docs/features/rocketry.md): propellant chemistry, the rocket workshop and the first rockets.

Only rockets that come back down to earth: no space launches yet (the owner's choice, 3 October 2026).
- Chemistry: iodine from kelp (sulfuric acid), ammonium perchlorate from salt and ammonia, silver iodide.
- The rocket workshop (MachineKind.ROCKET_WORKSHOP, recipe type rocket_assembly) makes solid propellant, rocket
  parts and rockets.
- Rockets (Java: rocketry/RocketItem): a survey rocket, a cloud-seeding rocket, a clear-sky rocket, signal flares and
  illumination flares. Each rises as a firework and does its work at the top ({@link #LAUNCH_DELAY} ticks later).

tools/check_mod_data.py keeps the numbers here and in Java the same.
