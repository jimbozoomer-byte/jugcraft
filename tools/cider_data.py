"""JSON resources for the cider mill (fall additions 2), from tools/agriculture.py: the apple tree (its sapling, leaves that
blossom and fruit, loot and worldgen), the Cider Press and the Cider Barrel (models, blockstates, items, names, messages,
loot and tags).

Called from agriculture_data.py (assets, loot, tags, worldgen). Formats follow vanilla Minecraft 26.3's own files. The
press's moving parts (the apples in its hopper, the pulp in its basket, its screw and pressing plate, and the juice in
its trough) are drawn by the client's CiderPressRenderer; the block model is its frame.
