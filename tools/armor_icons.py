"""The 3D armor sets' 16x16 inventory icons: the bronze and steel armor's, the knight armor (tools/knight_armor.py)
drawn small, and Bloodthorn Armor's, Reforged White Diamond's, Hades Armor's, Sunset Gem's, Pharaoh's, and the Dread
Knight's, Valkyrie's, Wayfarer's and Spartan's (tools/bloodthorn_armor.py, tools/white_diamond_armor.py,
tools/hades_armor.py, tools/sunset_gem_armor.py, tools/pharaoh_armor.py and the four after it, below), in the owner's
style for item icons (vanilla's own size, a one-pixel outline in each
part's darkest tone, never pure black, light from the top left, a few flat tones, chunky parts that read at a glance).

Each piece is one hand-drawn map, tools/armor_icons/<piece>.txt: 16 lines of 16 symbols, which the owner can edit
directly (lines starting with # are comments). A map names no colours, only what each pixel is made of, so one map
serves both metals: steel_<piece> is coloured from armor_paint.STEEL (the owner's sampled steel, gold and leather) and
bronze_<piece> from armor_paint.BRONZE, the same palettes the 3D armor is painted in.

What each icon carries of the knight (front view, as vanilla draws armor; boots in vanilla's stance):
    helmet      the big diamond crest overhanging the helm, with its nested chevrons and the finial, the horn fins at
                its corners, the dark seam under it, the eye slits beside the nasal bar, and the gold collar
    chestplate  the two layered pauldrons with nested L's toward the armpit, the light chevron plate over the chest
                with its bold dark V and the keel at its point, the hem lame, and the dark under-layer at the waist
    leggings    the brown leather belt (the under-layer's light top edge, two plates, the strap across, the
                under-layer showing at the centre) over the skirt of four plate lames, light over dark, widening to
                the hem, with the dark seam down the middle
    boots       greaves with a rolled top, a shadow under it and the knee cop's small chevron, and sabatons of banded
                instep lames, light over dark, with pointed toes
The bronze icons add what the bronze variant adds in brass: the finial and horn tips, rivets on the pauldron lames, the
hem lame and the skirt lames' ends, and the belt buckle.

Symbols:
    .           transparent
    O D M L H   the plate: outline, dark, mid, mid-light, light (the ramp's "dark", "mid", "mid_light", "light"; the
                outline is its "void" taken down to an item icon's outline depth, OUTLINE_LUMA)
    F Y g       the gold trim (gold on steel, brass on bronze): dark, light, outline
    R r         fittings (finial, horn tips, rivets): brass on bronze (light, dark); on steel the plate's own light
                and mid, since the steel has no brass there (knight_armor.py, the bronze variant): put R where the
                steel plate is lit and r where it is mid
    Q           the belt's centre: a brass buckle on bronze, the strap's lighter middle on steel (as the owner drew it)
    w k b B     leather: outline, strap, plate, top edge ("leather_darkest", "leather_dark", "leather_mid",
                "leather_light")
    u U         the dark under-layer: fill, top edge ("under_dark", "under_light")

A set may instead have maps of its own, tools/armor_icons/<set>/<piece>.txt, with its own symbols (OWN): Bloodthorn
Armor (tools/bloodthorn_armor.py) has bloodthorn/helmet.txt and so on, coloured from armor_paint.BLOODTHORN:
    helmet      the boxy great helm cut by three slits (two wide, a narrower one below) under its crown of spikes: the
                tall one at the centre, a long pair and a lower pair splayed wider
    chestplate  the pauldrons tilted up toward the outside, the collar with its dark inside showing, the breastplate
                running coral to crimson, and the magenta V over the dark waist
    leggings    the dark belt; the tassets, lit at the top left with a nested L toward the inner lower corner, their
                tops stepping down to the centre; the front plate with its dark strap; the diamond knee plates on the
                dark knees
    boots       two chunky boots in magenta and plum strips, notched dark at the top
Their symbols:

    H L R M D S V   the metal, light to dark: "light" (orange), "mid_light" (coral), "gold_light" (the design's red,
                    see armor_paint.BLOODTHORN), "mid" (crimson), "dark" (magenta), "seam" (plum), "void" (dark plum)
    U m u x         the under-layer: "under_light", "under_mid", "under_dark", and "under_darkest", which is both the
                    eye slits and the under-layer's own outline
Reforged White Diamond (tools/white_diamond_armor.py) has reforged_white_diamond/helmet.txt and so on, coloured from
armor_paint.WHITE_DIAMOND and drawn after the owner's renders of each piece on its own:
    helmet      the white V crest, its point dipping into the charcoal T of the face, the light blue peak behind it, and
                the swept wings rising outside it
    chestplate  the wing pauldrons rising toward the outside over their lames, the light blue gem at the collar and the
                white V down the chest, strips at the waist (no sleeves: the owner's chestplate on its own has none)
    leggings    the belt, its top edge light blue, over the A of the two tassets, white along their outer edges and
                lined lavender, then blue, inside, with the striped under-skirt between and under them

    U m u x         the charcoal under-layer: "under_light", "under_mid", "under_dark", "under_darkest" (the face)
Hades Armor (tools/hades_armor.py) has hades/helmet.txt and so on, coloured from armor_paint.HADES and drawn after the
owner's renders of each piece on its own (the boots, which the owner's sheet cuts off, after the 3D boots):
    helmet      the two horns rising from the helm's top corners, lit at their bends; the narrow crown's lit top band
                over the beak: the blue slate V of the brow falling from its outer corners to the ridge, dark above it,
                the slits on either side, the ridge below the V's point; at its foot the two cheeks and the chin, the
                dark collar between them
    chestplate  two plates a side, the mantle and the fin under it, rising toward the outside; the blue slate V at the

    U m u x         the under-layer: "under_light", "under_mid", "under_dark", and "under_darkest", which is both the
                    eye slits and the under-layer's own outline
    R k r w         the blood-red cloth: "leather_light", "leather_mid_light", "leather_mid", and "leather_darkest", its
                    own outline
Sunset Gem (tools/sunset_gem_armor.py) has sunset_gem/helmet.txt and so on, coloured from armor_paint.SUNSET_GEM and
drawn after the owner's renders of each piece on its own:
    helmet      the crown of gem shards, the broad cream spike over the band, a smaller one at each corner and a shard
                splayed out at each side; the cream brow over the olive face with its yellow nose bar, peach cheek
                guards round the open chin, the coral jaw
    chestplate  the wings, cream and yellow crescents rising from the shoulders to their tips, the peach pauldrons under
                them, the breastplate with the cream U of its collar, in strips yellow and apricot down to coral (no
                forearms: the owner's chestplate on its own has none)
    leggings    the belt's red V, the flaps fanning out from it with crimson inner edges and a glint at each hip, the
                centre panel in strips, the hem with the crimson band and its mauve middle, parted between the legs
    boots       two chunky boots, a crimson cuff with a mauve middle, a peach strip, coral with crimson blocks, red
                soles, a shard flaring up from each outer side

                        brown (the olive's darkest tone is far lighter than an icon's outline). None of the four maps
                        needs it yet: the olive shows only inside the helm's face.
Pharaoh (tools/pharaoh_armor.py) has pharaoh/helmet.txt and so on, coloured from armor_paint.PHARAOH and drawn after
the owner's render (its boots, which the render hides under the skirt, after the 3D boots):

    boots       two sandal-greaves: the gold-rimmed teal cuff, the tan wraps with the framed teal shin plate, the gold
                strap and sole
Their symbols:

after the owner's sheet and screenshots; each part is outlined in its own darkest tone, "O" or one named below. A tone
written "~<tone>" in OWN is that tone taken down to OUTLINE_LUMA, as "O" is, for a part whose own darkest tone is too
