"""Arms, batch 42 (docs/features/arms.md): longswords, greatswords, rapiers, flanged maces, war hammers, glaives,
halberds, spears and lances in bronze and steel; Arms II, batch 45: daggers, sabres, estocs, battle axes, flails,
scythes, quarterstaves and pikes, each with a trait of its own (TRAITS); Arms III, batch 46: two-handed swings for
the heavy arms (TWO_HANDED) and zweihanders, mauls, executioner's swords and bills; and Arms IV, batch 47: labryses,
battleblades, war forks, kamas and war picks, in an ornate style; and Arms V, batch 48: twinblades, nodachis,
earthbreakers, katars, moonblades and kusarigamas, each with a weapon art (ARTS), a special move with its own animation
and its own shape of damage.

After studying Epic Knights (all rights reserved) and Simply Swords (Timefall Development License) for how they draw,
animate and keep their weapons cheap; none of their code, models, numbers or art is used. What carried over is the
approach: one table of weapon kinds and their traits, one sprite and one model per weapon over a shared in-hand pose
per kind, and no per-tick code. Every trait is one of 26.3's own item components (swing animation, attack range,
blocking, piercing and kinetic attacks, shield disabling), so the game runs and checks them like its own weapons.

Java: weapons/JugcraftArms.java (keep KINDS and the numbers in sync; tools/check_mod_data.py checks them). Art:
tools/arms_art.py.

# Each kind of arm. Attack damage is added to the metal's bonus (bronze 2, steel 2.5) and the hand's 1, as a sword's
# 3 is; the iron sword makes 6 at 1.6 attacks a second. Speed is the attack-speed modifier (the sword's is -2.4: 4 -
# 2.4 = 1.6 a second). swing: the attack animation and how long it lasts in ticks (a plain swing is 6). reach: the
# nearest and farthest a hit lands, in blocks (a hand reaches 3; creative adds 2); margin widens the target's hitbox.
# disable: seconds a hit stops a shield blocking (the axe's 5). wear: durability a hit costs. knockback: extra attack
# knockback. parry: the share of damage from in front that blocking with it stops (a shield stops all).
# held: how much larger than a sword it is held. pierce: it thrusts through every target in line, as the spear's
# jab does. tags: the vanilla item tags it joins (the enchantments follow).

# Arms III (batch 46): two-handed swings (weapons/TwoHanded.java; client/arms/TwoHandedInput.java), after studying the
# greatsword of Fiery Combat (a Bedrock add-on; nothing of it is used). A click with one of these in the main hand
# starts a committed swing instead of vanilla's instant hit:
#   strike: the tick the blow lands, counted from the click; it is when the kind's motion lands its blow

#   combo: how many attacks the kind's combo has (as its motion); the last is the finishing blow, FINISHER times as
#     strong.
# While a swing is in the air the wielder moves at 1 - TWO_HANDED_SLOW of their speed and cannot sprint, and a shield
# (anything that blocks) in the off hand stops a swing from starting. A click within QUEUE_TICKS of a swing's end

# was at the click (vanilla's rule), and each foe is struck through vanilla's own thrust attack (Player.stabAttack):
