"""Pixel Hollows (a rare retro-electronics cave biome) and the Retro Trader who sells maps to it.

Single source of truth for their IDs, recipes, loot, tags, worldgen, biome and sounds.
generate_material_data.py writes the JSON from these tables and check_mod_data.py audits them.
The Java side lives in world/ (PixelHollows, RetroTrader); the checker compares the two.

Balance (docs/features/pixel-hollows.md, docs/features/retro-trader.md):
- Copper and redstone: 1.5x the vanilla per-chunk average inside the biome (an extra half of the vanilla
  attempts, with the same height spread, filtered to the biome). Tin likewise, when tin is enabled.
- Pixel crystal clusters do not grow or tick. They drop 1-2 shards (Fortune adds 0-1 per level), so shards are
  finite; nothing turns back into shards.
- The trader's shard buyback never pays more per shard than his cheapest possible shard sale (see TRADES).
