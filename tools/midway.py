"""The fall fair midway (fall addition 26): the High Striker, Ring Toss and the plush prizes they give. The numbers here
are what agriculture/HighStrikerBlock, Midway, RingTossBlock, TossRing and PlushBlock use; tools/check_mod_data.py
compares them. tools/midway_data.py writes the JSON, tools/midway_textures.py the textures.

The High Striker stands five blocks tall: a strike pad at its foot (part 0), the painted tower with its lamps (parts 1 to
4) and the bell on top. Struck with a Carnival Mallet, its puck climbs `levels` lamps (two a part, on parts 1 to 4) by
the blow's strength: a full swing (a fully charged attack) is `full_low` to `full_high` strong, a critical (falling)
swing `crit_bonus` stronger; `ring_at` or more reaches the top (`levels` + 1) and rings the bell for a prize, less climbs
that share of the lamps. The puck climbs one lamp
every `rise_ticks`, rests `hold_ticks` at its height, then drops back a lamp a tick.

Ring Toss is a crate of nine bottles. A Toss Ring landing on its top within `ringer_radius` pixels of a bottle's neck,
thrown from at least `min_distance` blocks off, is a ringer: it stays on the bottle `ringer_ticks` and wins a prize; any
other landing drops the ring to be thrown again.

A prize is a roll of the loot table jugcraft:gameplay/midway_prize: a plush, weighted by `weight`.
