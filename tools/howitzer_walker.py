"""The Howitzer Walker model, after the owner's own render of 9 October 2026: a tall two-legged artillery walker, a
riveted olive hull carrying a big howitzer in an open cradle, three headlamps, bumper rails round every edge, grab
hoops on the roof, and reverse-jointed legs on coil-sprung shock absorbers over broad hinged feet. A model only, by the
owner's choice (9 October 2026: "I just want you to model stuff, don't implement"): no entity, recipe or renderer yet.

- Hull: a riveted olive box notched at its front top left, where the gun's cradle lies; round bumper rails along
  every edge; a big pivot axle with hubs under its nose and an A-arm linkage on its right down to the hip; dark
  recessed side panels; a chrome rail on brackets under the nose; three chrome-ringed headlamps up the front's right
  and two small lamps low on its left, an amber indicator at the top right; two grab hoops on the roof, two handles
  on the right side, the pilot's hatch ring at the roof's rear left; a louvred vent on the back.
- Gun: a trunnion hub in a cradle of a floor and two walls, open on top; a breech block and cap behind, the barrel
  with a thick jacket at its root and a flared muzzle brake, recoil rods along the cradle. It sits elevated 25
  degrees and recoils when it fires.
- Waist: a riveted plate over the hips with an amber indicator, a centre block, and big hip hubs either side.
- Legs: a hip drum, a broad flat thigh plate angled back under its armour plate, a knee drum, a shin angled forward
  under a shin guard, a chrome shock absorber in a coil spring behind the thigh, an ankle housing and a broad foot
  with a hinge strip, an upturned toe plate in front and a heel behind.
- The blast: a cartoon star burst and three smoke puffs at the muzzle, for the "shoot" clip.

Units are pixels, the walker facing +z with the ground at y = 0. The whole walker is saved as a Blockbench project
(art/howitzer_walker/howitzer_walker.bbmodel): every box in groups with their joints as origins (the shins under the
thighs, the gun under the hull with the burst and puffs at its muzzle), the textures embedded, and two animation clips
sampled from the curves below: "walk" (a floaty, bouncy stride) and "shoot" (recoil, a rocking hull, the burst and the
puffs). `python tools/howitzer_walker.py --bbmodel --preview out.png` rewrites the project and renders previews.
