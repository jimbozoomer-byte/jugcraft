"""Diagonal connections (docs/features/diagonal-connections.md) for tools/generate_material_data.py.

Fences, glass panes, bars and walls join diagonally as well as straight. The Java side (diagonal/DiagonalConnections)
gives every FenceBlock and IronBarsBlock four more properties, north_east, south_east, south_west and north_west, and
sets them only for blocks in the block tag #jugcraft:connects_diagonally. A vanilla wall in the tag keeps its own states
and becomes its diagonal wall, jugcraft:diagonal_<wall> (diagonal/DiagonalWallBlock), while it joins diagonally. Here
each block in the tag gets:

- a diagonal arm model, jugcraft:block/diagonal/<block>: a child of the block's own side model (so it keeps the
  block's textures, translucency and lighting) whose elements are turned 45 degrees about the post. Minecraft's
  "rescale" stretches a 45-degree element by the square root of 2 across the block, so an arm drawn from the edge to the
  middle reaches the corner; the widths are drawn narrower by the same factor so they come out as wide as the
  straight arm's.
- four more multipart parts in its blockstate: that arm turned 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees for north_east, south_east,
  south_west and north_west.

Vanilla's fences, panes and bars are rebuilt in assets/minecraft/blockstates: vanilla's own parts, naming vanilla's models
by ID, plus the diagonals. Vanilla's walls are left as they are; each diagonal wall gets a blockstate of its own: the
wall's post, its low sides and the diagonals. Jugcraft's fences get their diagonal parts added to the blockstates their own
generators wrote, so this runs last in generate_material_data.assets().
