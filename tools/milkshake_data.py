"""The owner's milkshakes' models (tools/milkshakes.py): the glass as the page draws it, in its own coordinates (a dish
set down faces whoever set it down with its south side, so the drawing's view is the view of it set down). Every face
wears the milkshake's one texture (block/menu/<name>, tools/milkshake_art.py) at its place in milkshakes.LAYOUT; the
north and west sides wear the south's and east's.

Called from menu_data.py (the "milkshake" template, as every set-down dish's model is made) and agriculture_data.py
(each milkshake's item is its 3D glass). Formats follow vanilla Minecraft 26.3's own files.
