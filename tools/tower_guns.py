"""Tower guns (batch 54, docs/features/tower-guns.md): five heavy emplacements built to stand on top of a tower.

The owner asked for "more guns that look very similar to" a heavy mortar on a turntable mount (a picture of third-party
art used only for its mood: a concrete ring plinth, a railed turntable deck, a yellow armoured cradle with round
ports and pipework, and a fat black barrel), in Jugcraft's style: two that take a 3x3 top and three that take 5x5.

- Bastion Mortar (3x3): a compact high-arc mortar; Heavy Shells.
- Bastion Autocannon (3x3): twin quick-firing barrels in a yellow gunhouse; holds fire; Flak Shells.
- Grand Mortar (5x5): the full emplacement, with a stepped plinth, a tall cradle with an elevation gear and the
  biggest barrel; Great Shells, whose burst reaches further.
- Fortress Rifle (5x5): a long-barrelled gun in an armoured gunhouse that throws Heavy Shells fast and flat, twice as
  far as a mortar.
- Triple Battery (5x5): a low turret with three barrels that fire a salvo of three Heavy Shells.

Each is placed from its item onto the top of a tower (or anything else), centred on the block clicked, and needs a
solid top under its whole footprint. It works like the big guns (batch 51, tools/artillery.py): a gunner climbs
aboard, marks a target with a Range Finder or looks where to fire, and presses attack. Every burst is a Blast
(weapons/Blast): it hurts living things and never breaks a block.

Java: artillery/TowerGun and artillery/JugcraftTowerGuns; client/TowerGunRenderer draws the parts exported here
(assets/jugcraft/tower_gun_quads.json). tools/check_mod_data.py checks that the numbers match.
