"""JSON resources for the thirteenth batch of Halloween decorations, treats, from tools/agriculture.py: the Witch's Brew
Punch Bowl, the Barmbrack and its ring, and Giant Candy props; their names, messages, loot and tags. The treats
themselves (soul cakes, pumpkin bread, cupcakes, cookies, the latte and the punch) are foods in ITEMS, whose item
models and names agriculture_data.py writes with the others.

Called from agriculture_data.py (assets, loot, tags). Formats follow vanilla Minecraft 26.3's own files and the earlier
batches' (tools/decor_data.py to decor12_data.py). The Barmbrack is modelled facing north and eaten from its west end,
like a vanilla cake; the blockstate turns it.
