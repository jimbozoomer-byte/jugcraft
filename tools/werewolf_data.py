"""JSON resources for full-moon werewolves (fall addition 23), from tools/agriculture.py: wolfsbane (vanilla's flower and
potted-flower shapes) and its wild patch; the Werewolf Rug, a pelt laid flat with its head at one end; the silver dagger,
silver arrow and pelt items; names; loot (the flower, the potted flower, the rug, and the werewolf's own drops); tags (the
silver weapons, the dagger's repair metal, swords and arrows, the werewolf's haunts, the flower tags); and worldgen. The
recipes are in SHAPED and SHAPELESS, the advancements in HALLOWEEN_ADVANCEMENTS.

Called from agriculture_data.py. Formats follow vanilla Minecraft 26.3's own files.
