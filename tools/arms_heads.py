"""The flail's swinging head (docs/features/arms-restyle.md, "The flail's head swings"). On 5 October 2026 the owner
asked that "flails should have an animated ball that actually flails around". So in the hand a flail's model is its
handle alone (tools/arms_art.py flail_handle), and its chain and spiked ball are two small box models, a link and a
ball, that client/arms/FlailHeads.java draws one by one where a little chain simulation puts them each frame: hanging
under gravity, trailing the arm as it moves and whipping round after a blow.

What this writes:
- models/item/arms_<kind>_link.json and arms_<kind>_ball.json: the shapes, built from boxes as the house style asks
  (docs/ART_DIRECTION.md): closed boxes, no two faces facing the same way in one plane, flat tones from a short ramp.
  They have no parent and no display transforms, so FlailHeads places them exactly;
- models/item/<item>_link.json and <item>_ball.json: each metal's, on that flail's own _model texture, whose free
  corner holds the swatches the boxes are coloured from (paint_swatches);
- the flail's item definition picks them by the custom_model_data string FlailHeads puts on its render-only copies of
  the stack (LINK_CASE, BALL_CASE), and otherwise shows the flail as before (definition());
- arms_heads.json, per item: where the chain hangs from the handle and where the hand holds it (model pixels), the
  links and the ball, the haft's radius (the ball swings clear of it), and the hand poses the handle is drawn with, so
  FlailHeads can put the chain where the handle's eye is drawn.

The measures are in the arms' design units (tools/arms_art.py) and scaled by the handle's own layout, so the head is
always in proportion to the handle it hangs from. All original.
