"""Pixel-art arms (the arms restyle, docs/features/arms-restyle.md): a weapon is designed once, along its own axis, and drawn
from that design twice:

- as its inventory icon, on the exact 45-degree pixel diagonal, in flat tones lit from the top left with a one-pixel
  outline, as vanilla draws its swords and as the best weapon mods draw theirs (studied: Simply Swords and Epic Knights,
  32 and 48 pixels a side; nothing of theirs is used);
- as the texture of a 3D model held in the hand, upright (the model lays it along the diagonal), in which every part
  has its own thickness: a thin blade with a thicker ridge, a chunky guard and pommel, a round grip (after studying
  RPG Style More Weapons, whose weapons are built of many small boxes; nothing of theirs is used either).

A design is in design units: s along the weapon from the butt up (the hand at `grip`), t across it, negative towards
the lit side. Parts are flat shapes (strips with a profile, polygons, discs, single pixels) in a material; the shading
is worked out from the shapes, as a pixel artist would: the edge facing the light is the brightest tone, the edge
away from it the darkest, the inside between, each part outlined against the next.
