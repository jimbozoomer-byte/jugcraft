"""JSON resources for the Theremin (fall additions 19), from tools/agriculture.py: its models (a walnut cabinet on four
slender legs with a brass top; the tall copper pitch antenna on a bakelite insulator at the player's right, the copper
volume loop held out at the left; a speaker grille, two bakelite knobs and the magic-eye tube in front, dark when silent
and glowing green while it plays) and blockstate; the item; names and messages; loot; and tags. The recipe is in SHAPED;
the advancement in HALLOWEEN_ADVANCEMENTS.

Called from agriculture_data.py (assets, loot, tags). Formats follow vanilla Minecraft 26.3's own files.
