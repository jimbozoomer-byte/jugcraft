"""Halloween decorations, batch 17: the Witch's Workshop (docs/features/witchs-workshop.md), the first five prop sets of
the Witching Season plan (docs/features/witching-season.md), drawn from the owner's reference pictures. Models and
textures: tools/decor17_data.py, sculpted on the toolkit in tools/flora_art.py.

1. Horned Skull Cauldron (agriculture/HornedSkullCauldronBlock): an iron pot with a ram's skull on its front that holds
   water or `levels` bottles of one potion, bubbles over heat, floats up to `floaters` things, and, stirred with the
   Brew Ladle over heat, wafts a potion's effect onto up to `waft_players` players within `waft_range` blocks at
   `waft_fraction` of its duration. The Ember Bed is a heat source (block tag jugcraft:heat_sources).
2. Wrought-iron candelabra (agriculture/CandelabrumBlock and its kinds): iron fittings whose candles (CANDLES, drawn by
   the client) take one of WAXES and burn with one of FLAMES; wax drips grow while lit (`drip_stages` stages, one
   random tick in `drip_chance`) and shears scrape them off.
3. Enchanted Broom and Dustpan (agriculture/EnchantedBroomBlock, DustpanBlock): rubbed with Flying Ointment the broom
   sweeps dropped items within `range` blocks to a Dustpan every `sweep_ticks`, at most `max_moves` a sweep, for
   `charge_ticks`. The Broom Rack shows three brooms.
4. Cabinet of Curiosities (agriculture/ShowcaseBlock): the Curiosity Cabinet shows nine things, the Bell Jar one, the
   Moth Display Case pinned moths that stir at night.
5. Oddity Jars (agriculture/OddityJarBlock): eyeballs that watch, a heart that beats as a redstone clock, a bat that
   wakes (in a wider, taller jar, so its wings stay inside the glass), a two-headed snake and a drumming hand.
6. The bigger jars, several blocks placed and broken as one (agriculture/MultiDecorationBlock with a third, "away",
   axis): the Giant's Beating Heart (GIANT_HEART, 3 x 3 x 3, GiantBeatingHeartBlock), a slow redstone clock whose heart
   swells with each beat, and the Tall Specimen Jar (1 x 2 x 1) and Specimen Tank (2 x 2 x 2) (SPECIMEN_VESSELS,
   SpecimenVesselBlock), the Specimen Jar's specimens floating big in glowing fluid.
Every recipe follows the agriculture feature switch.
