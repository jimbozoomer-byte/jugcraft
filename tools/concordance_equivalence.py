"""Roadmap step 21: bounded material equivalence (docs/features/arcane-concordance-equivalence.md).

The Balancewrights' Assay. A restricted catalogue of mundane materials each has an exact Prima Materia value (grains a
unit, as a fraction), and says whether an Assayer's Scale may dissolve it into grains or form it from them. Dissolving
gives the batch's exact value rounded down once; forming costs FORM_MARKUP of it, rounded up once; so nothing is ever
rounded into existence and every round trip loses. Only catalogued, plain items are weighed: anything carrying an
inventory, a unique identity, a bound creature, other data or magic, or tagged as excluded, never is (Java:
equivalence/Eligibility.java), whatever a player holds or a recipe viewer shows.

The conversion graph is declared here too: the vanilla recipes between catalogued materials (with the containers they
give back and their byproducts), and the external sources that legitimately add matter (a cobblestone generator, farms,
bees). tools/check_mod_data.py and Java's CycleAudit both refuse a catalogue in which any recipe, or the scale's own
dissolving and forming, gains value, and search every cycle for a profitable one; sources are kept apart.

The definitions are data (data/jugcraft/concordance/{material,transmutation}, read by Java's concordance/equivalence;
the server side is concordance/assay). tools/concordance.py merges these tables into its own.
