"""The Farmhouse Kitchen (the first slice of the kitchen and cooking expansion in docs/branches/AGRICULTURE.md): the
Kitchen Stove, the Skillet, the Cutting Board and its knives, and the kitchen cabinets, drawn in the owner's own farming
and food textures (art/owner-library, imported by tools/owner_art.py). The numbers here are what
agriculture/KitchenStoveBlock(Entity), SkilletBlock(Entity), CuttingBoardBlock(Entity), CuttingRecipe, KitchenKnifeItem
and KitchenCabinetBlock(Entity) use; tools/check_mod_data.py compares them. tools/kitchen_data.py writes the JSON.

The Kitchen Stove is a brick range. Lit with flint and steel or a fire charge (a shovel puts it out), it gives light
`light` and heats the block on top of it like a campfire (block tag jugcraft:heat_sources), so a Cooking Pot, Canning
Kettle, Candy Kettle, Wax Melting Pot or Skillet cooks on it. With nothing on top, its hob cooks up to `slots` foods at
once by vanilla's campfire recipes, `speed` times as fast as a campfire; each pops off when done. Only what a campfire
cooks goes on the hob; anything else (a pot, a skillet, a bucket) is placed or used on top as usual. It burns no fuel,
like a campfire, and anything standing on its hot top is burnt as by a magma block.

The Skillet is an iron pan set on any heat source. Use anything a campfire cooks on it to put up to `capacity` of one
food in; it fries them one after another by the campfire recipe that takes them, `speed` times as fast as a campfire (a
furnace's pace), into the pan beside them. Use it with an empty hand to take back everything in it.

The Cutting Board holds one thing set on it (anything, for show). Use a knife on it to cut what is on it by a cutting
recipe (type jugcraft:cutting: an ingredient, the tool that cuts it, and what it is cut into); each cut costs the knife
one durability. Use it with an empty hand to take back what is on it. Knives (item tag jugcraft:knives, which holds the
Carving Knife too) also cut slices from pies and the roast turkey, and from a vanilla cake (before the cake is eaten, so
a hungry cook still slices it).

A cut is a whole split into parts: the parts' hunger and saturation add up to no more than the whole's, so cutting is
never a gain (docs/BALANCE.md). Raw cuts are barely worth eating; cook them on the stove, in the skillet or in a
furnace, smoker or on a campfire.
