"""The named materials an item icon map is coloured in (docs/ITEM_ICONS.md, rule 6 and "Maps and the checker").

A map names what each pixel is made of by role, never a colour (O D M L H the main material, g f F Y a second one, w b B
wood, k K a wrap, a A a stone, e E an accent). A map that is not an arm declares which material fills each role:

    # materials: main=copper second=brass wood=wood

and tools/check_icon_maps.py previews it in those materials and checks each one's ramp. The arms are coloured in their
style's materials instead (tools/arms_pixel.py STYLES, tools/arms_variants_art.py LINE_STYLES).

Each material is an arms_pixel.Material, a ramp darkest first: outline (away from the light), outline (towards it, used
by the 3D models and by the icons only for the chain's `c`), dark, mid, light, highlight. A new material is added here,
with a comment saying where it is used. Every colour here is drawn fresh; none is sampled from Mojang's textures.
