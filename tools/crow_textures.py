"""The crow's texture (fall additions 4) (requires Pillow): glossy blue-black feathers, a dark grey beak and feet, and
bright eyes, laid out for the client's CrowModel (64 by 32; each box's faces where a vanilla model box puts them).

Called from crop_textures.crop_textures(). Every pixel is drawn here by code, from a fixed seed; no Mojang texture is
read, traced or recoloured.
