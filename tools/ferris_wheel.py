"""The Ferris wheel (fall addition 27): a fairground big wheel, real-life sized, turned by the mod's kinetic power. The
numbers here are what agriculture/FerrisWheel and FerrisWheelBoothBlock(Entity) use; tools/check_mod_data.py compares
them. tools/ferris_wheel_data.py writes the JSON and the quads the client draws the wheel from, and
tools/ferris_wheel_textures.py the textures.

The Ferris Wheel block is its booth: a loading platform with the operator's controls, and the only real block. Placed,
it raises the wheel over itself, an entity: two A-frames of lattice steel standing `frame_feet` blocks either side of the
booth, the hub `hub` blocks up, and two rims `radius` blocks round with `cars` cars hanging between them, `seats` to a
car. It needs a clear space `width` blocks across (along the wheel), `height` blocks up from the booth's foot and `depth`
blocks through (along the axle); the wheel faces whoever places it.

The booth takes kinetic energy (KE) from a shaft, gearbox or source touching it, as a machine does: up to `need` KE a
tick, which turns the wheel at full speed, one turn in `turn_ticks` ticks; less turns it slower, in proportion. It speeds
up by at most `accel` of full speed a tick and slows by `decel` a tick when the power stops. A hand crank (16 KE a tick
for 100 ticks a crank) turns it at full speed, so one player can crank for their friends.

Using the booth puts a player in the empty seat of the car nearest the bottom. Getting off (sneak) sets the rider down
on the platform in front of the booth, however high their car was. If a block stands where a car is about to go, the
wheel stops (it is jammed) until it is cleared; it never carries a rider into a block. Riding all the way round earns
Round and Round; riding all the way round with someone in the seat beside you, Two to a Car.
