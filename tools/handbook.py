"""The Engineer's Handbook: in-game guide content, generated from the same tables as the mod.

generate_material_data.py writes it to assets/jugcraft/handbook/en_us.json; the client screen
(client/HandbookScreen.java) reads it. Numbers and recipes come from tools/machines.py and
tools/materials.py, so the book stays in step with the game. Only the prose is written here.

Format: {"chapters": [{"title", "icon", "pages": [{"title", "icon", "text": [paragraphs],
