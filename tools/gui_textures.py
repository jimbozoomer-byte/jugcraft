"""Machine screens (batch 22, docs/features/machine-screens.md): three themed backgrounds and what each machine is for.

Every machine screen is a 176x166 machine bay with the player inventory, and a 92-pixel control terminal joined on its
right: a CRT that says what the machine does and how it is doing, the side and redstone controls, and a keyboard.
The look follows the machine's model (docs/ART_DIRECTION.md):

- "diesel": the steampunk and dieselpunk machines. Riveted dark iron with brass, an amber-on-brown terminal and an
  orange keyboard, after the owner's first reference (an orange terminal with a pixel keyboard).
- "electric": the electric-look power gear. Graphite panels with mint-green glow, a green-text monitor, after the
  dark green-text monitor reference.
- "lab": chemistry and electronics. Slate-teal panels with cyan accents, after the slate-teal inventory and teal
  mech-GUI references.

All drawn here, original. client/MachineScreen reads the themes from assets/jugcraft/gui/machine_themes.json and draws
slots, gauges and text in the theme's colours; the taglines are lang keys container.jugcraft.tagline.<machine>.
