"""Batch 44: sixteen one-block machines rebuilt as big, weathered dieselpunk multi-blocks.

The look follows the owner's reference pictures: rusted riveted steel on skid feet, green patina copper housings with
perforated covers, ribbed coil stacks and banded domes, copper and rusty pipe runs with hex-nut fittings, chipped red
paint, a big turbine fan, blue pipe caps and glowing amber conduits (textures: tools/dieselrust_textures.py).

Each model is in structure space like tools/large_machines.py: facing north (front at z = 0), the master block at
0..16 on every axis, the machine reaching to its right (-x), up and back (+z). Footprints are in
large_machines.FOOTPRINTS and MachineKind.footprint(). The old one-block models stay as the "compact" look of copies
built before batch 44 (steampunk_models.COMPACT).
