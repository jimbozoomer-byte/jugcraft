"""Writes machine block models, blockstates and item models in one visual style.

Two styles exist. Both are visual only: they never change a block, its footprint or how it works.
- "steampunk" (tools/steampunk_models.py): detailed brass, copper and iron models for every machine.
- "classic" (tools/large_machines.py plus textured cubes): the original look.

generate_material_data.py writes DEFAULT_STYLE into the mod's own assets and the other style into
the built-in resource pack resourcepacks/alternate_machines, which players can turn on in
Options > Resource Packs. To make the other style the default, change DEFAULT_STYLE and regenerate.

Model elements are tuples (from, to, texture) or (from, to, texture, options):
- from/to are pixels in structure space (the master block is 0..16 on every axis, facing north).
- texture is a texture name, or a dict {face: name} with "*" as the default. A name ending in "!"
  stretches the whole 16x16 texture over that face (gauges, doors, windows); otherwise the texture
  is mapped by position, like vanilla's automatic UVs.
- options may hold "rotation": (axis, angle, origin) or (axis, angle, origin, rescale); rescale stretches a 45-degree
  element to span the block's diagonal (conveyor slopes). Rotated elements are never sliced between
  blocks, so keep each one inside a single block's reach.
