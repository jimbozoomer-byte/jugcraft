"""Arms VII, batch 56 (docs/features/arms-vii.md): named variants of the arms, each a kind of tools/arms.py KINDS with its
own look, in three kinds of line:

- styles, crafted at a smithing table from a steel arm, the style's pattern and a material, which keep the arm's
  enchantments and wear: gilded (takes enchantments as gold does), ironclad (dieselpunk, twice as hard-wearing),
  bonecarved (strikes the undead harder) and runebound (glowing runes that mark a foe);
- trophies of eight bosses still to be made (docs/branches/BOSSES.md): no recipe; each boss's loot table is ready
  (loot_table/bosses/<boss>.json) for its encounter to drop one of its two; and of Vesperine, the Last Reaper
  (docs/features/vesperine.md), whose Vesper Scythe she drops (VesperineLoot; her trophy table lists it as theirs do);
- the arms of the owner's armor sets, each in its set's look (the Hades Armor's scythe): no recipe and, until the owner
  settles how a set is won, no loot table either; creative only for now. Like a trophy, epic and twice as hard-wearing.

A variant is an ArmItem of its kind (weapons/JugcraftArms.java VARIANTS), so its swing, reach, trait, two-handed blow,
weapon art and motion are its kind's; its line adds a perk or a boon (BOONS), worked on the server in ArmItem. The
numbers here and in Java are kept together by tools/check_mod_data.py (check_arms_variants). Art:
tools/arms_variants_art.py; the Runebound arms are smooth meshes in the hand, with icons rendered from them
(tools/arms_mesh.py).
