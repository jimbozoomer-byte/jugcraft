"""Roadmap step 14: ecological cultivation and living devices (docs/features/arcane-concordance-ecology.md).

The Greenwardens' practice. A garden is Verdant Beds and what grows in them. Each organism has a niche: a range for
each of five habitat factors (moisture, light, nutrients, diversity and magical disturbance), and grows on random ticks
(vanilla's, or a sprinkler's) at full pace while every factor is ideal, at half pace while some are only tolerable,
and not at all while any is outside its range. Every step costs the bed nutrients and dries it, and only declared
sources put nutrients back: a nitrogen fixer (Mendvetch), the Mulch Maw (waste, at a loss), bone meal and fertilizer.

Four living devices work the garden: the Verdant Heart (producer: nutrients into Verdance), the Mulch Maw (consumer:
waste into nutrients for the poorest bed), the Habitat Gauge (sensor: the habitat as a comparator signal) and the
Gleaner (collector: harvests mature crops for a Verdance each). The rules are data (data/jugcraft/concordance/organism
and disturbance, read by Java's concordance/ecology); the area round a plant is sampled within fixed bounds, at most
SAMPLES_PER_TICK a level a tick, and a sample is reused for FRESH_TICKS.

tools/concordance.py merges these tables into its own. Numbers the Java repeats are checked by tools/check_mod_data.py.
