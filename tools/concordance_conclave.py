"""Roadmap step 23: factions and the Starbound Conclave (docs/features/arcane-concordance-conclave.md).

The Starbound Conclave is the fellowship of the Concordance's traditions, which are its factions: every research entry
already belongs to one (Lampwrights, Greenwardens, Alembists, Starwatchers, Circlewrights, Spiritbinders, Crimson Vigil,
Runesmiths, Balancewrights, Hexweavers, Dreamwalkers). It replaces nothing: parties stay Jugcraft's parties, the town
stays the town, Jugs stay the only coin. A player who understands First Light swears its oath at a Conclave Lectern (or
with /jugcraft concordance conclave join) and earns RENOWN, which is standing and never a currency, from four kinds of
contribution, each bounded (Java: conclave/Conclave.java):

- research: each state a research entry reaches, once (1, 2, 5 and 10);
- commissions: the Conclave's posted tasks, each once a week, worth less each time and nothing after its third;
- teaching: another player advanced an entry by reading your notes, once per entry and learner, four per learner;
- projects: each stage you contributed to, and the whole project, once.

Ranks ask for renown, breadth (traditions with at least TRADITION_RENOWN) and variety (kinds) together, so no single
repeated deed reaches any. A member's obligation is to contribute something each week; a lapsed member keeps their
renown but takes no tier II or III commission and begins no project until they contribute again. Projects are personal
or a party's (Jugcraft's own parties); every stage has a solo alternative to its cooperation rule (enough contributors,
or contributions on enough different days). The definitions are data (data/jugcraft/concordance/commission and
concordance/project, read by Java's concordance/conclave). tools/concordance.py merges these tables into its own;
tools/check_mod_data.py checks the numbers the Java repeats and that a solo player can reach every rank.
